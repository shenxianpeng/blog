Due to the increasing frequency of software supply chain attacks in recent years, Google proposed a solution in 2021: Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts ("SLSA").

This article will introduce how we can generate and verify the provenance of software artifacts in a **non-GitHub** ecosystem to improve your project's SLSA Level.

Witness is a pluggable software supply chain risk management framework that automates, standardizes, and verifies software artifact provenance. It is a CNCF project under [in-toto](https://www.cncf.io/projects/in-toto/). It was originally authored by Testifysec and later donated to [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/).

## What is Witness

Witness is a pluggable supply chain security framework that creates a provenance trail for the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring software integrity from source code to target. It supports most major CI and infrastructure providers and is a versatile, flexible solution for ensuring software supply chain security.

The use of a secure Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) distribution system and the ability to verify Witness metadata further enhance the security of the process and help mitigate many software supply chain attack vectors.

Witness works by encapsulating commands executed within a continuous integration process, providing a provenance trail for each operation in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This allows for a detailed and verifiable record of how the software was built, by whom, and what tools were used.

This evidence can be used to assess policy compliance, detect any potential tampering or malicious activity, and ensure that only authorized users or machines can complete a given step in the process.

Summary - What Witness can do

* Verify who built the software, how it was built, and what tools were used
* Detect any potential tampering or malicious activity
* Ensure that only authorized users or machines can complete each step of the process
* Distribute Attestations and Policies

## How to use Witness

It mainly consists of three steps:

1. `witness run` - Runs the provided command and records an attestation about the execution.
2. `witness sign` - Signs the provided file using the provided key.
3. `witness verify` - Verifies the witness policy.

### Quick Start

This is a [Witness Demo repository](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/witness-demo) I created to demonstrate the Witness workflow. You can follow these steps:



#### Prepare the environment

Install Witness, download the demo project

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-toto/witness/main/install-witness.sh)
Latest version of Witness is 0.1.14
Downloading for linux amd64 from https://github.com/in-toto/witness/releases/download/v0.1.14/witness_0.1.14_linux_amd64.tar.gz
expected checksum: f9b67ca04cb391cd854aec3397eb904392ff689dcd3c38305d38c444781a5a67
file checksum:     f9b67ca04cb391cd854aec3397eb904392ff689dcd3c38305d38c444781a5a67
witness v0.1.14-aa35c1f
Witness v0.1.14 has been installed at /usr/local/bin/witness

git clone https://github.com/shenxianpeng/witness-demo.git
```

#### Create key pair

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -outform PEM -out witness-demo-key.pem
openssl pkey -in witness-demo-key.pem -pubout > witness-demo-pub.pem
```

### Prepare the Witness configuration file `.witness.yaml`

```yaml
run:
    signer-file-key-path: witness-demo-key.pem
    trace: false
verify:
    attestations:
        - "witness-demo-att.json"
    policy: policy-signed.json
    publickey: witness-demo-pub.pem
```

### Integrate build steps into the Attestation

```bash
witness run --step build -o witness-demo-att.json -- python3 -m pip wheel --no-deps -w dist .
INFO    Using config file: .witness.yaml
INFO    Starting environment attestor...
INFO    Starting git attestor...
INFO    Starting material attestor...
INFO    Starting command-run attestor...
Processing /tmp/witness-demo
Building wheels for collected packages: witness-demo
  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for witness-demo: started
  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for witness-demo: finished with status 'done'
  Stored in directory: /tmp/witness-demo/dist
Successfully built witness-demo
INFO    Starting product attestor...
```

That is, add the `witness run` command to the previous build command.

#### View verification data of the signed Attestation

Since the Attestation data is base64 encoded, it needs to be decoded for viewing.

```bash
cat witness-demo-att.json | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq

# The following is a partial output
 {
  "type": "https://witness.dev/attestations/command-run/v0.1",
  "attestation": {
    "cmd": [
      "python3",
      "-m",
      "pip",
      "wheel",
      "--no-deps",
      "-w",
      "dist",
      "."
    ],
    "stdout": "Processing /tmp/witness-demo\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: witness-demo\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for witness-demo: started\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for witness-demo: finished with status 'done'\n  Stored in directory: /tmp/witness-demo/dist\nSuccessfully built witness-demo\n",
    "exitcode": 0
  },
  "starttime": "2023-11-29T05:15:19.227943473-05:00",
  "endtime": "2023-11-29T05:15:20.078517025-05:00"
},
{
  "type": "https://witness.dev/attestations/product/v0.1",
  "attestation": {
    "dist/witness_demo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl": {
      "mime_type": "application/zip",
      "digest": {
        "gitoid:sha1": "gitoid:blob:sha1:b4b7210729998829c82208685837058f5ad614ab",
        "gitoid:sha256": "gitoid:blob:sha256:473a0f4c3be8a93681a267e3b1e9a7dcda1185436fe141f7749120a303721813",
        "sha256": "471985cd3b0d3e0101a1cbba8840819bfdc8d8f8cc19bd08add1e04be25b51ec"
      }
    }
  },
  "starttime": "2023-11-29T05:15:20.078579187-05:00",
  "endtime": "2023-11-29T05:15:20.081170078-05:00"
}
```

#### Create Policy file

`policy.json` defines or requires a step to have specific attributes or meet certain values, thus requiring verification of the Attestation for successful execution. For example, if the `expires` field has expired (is less than the current time), then `witness verify` will fail.

```json
{
  "expires": "2033-12-17T23:57:40-05:00",
  "steps": {
    "build": {
      "name": "build",
      "attestations": [
        {
          "type": "https://witness.dev/attestations/material/v0.1",
          "regopolicies": []
        },
        {
          "type": "https://witness.dev/attestations/command-run/v0.1",
          "regopolicies": []
        },
        {
          "type": "https://witness.dev/attestations/product/v0.1",
          "regopolicies": []
        }
      ],
      "functionaries": [
        {
          "publickeyid": "{{PUBLIC_KEY_ID}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "publickeys": {
    "{{PUBLIC_KEY_ID}}": {
      "keyid": "{{PUBLIC_KEY_ID}}",
      "key": "{{B64_PUBLIC_KEY}}"
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on policy attributes and settings, see: https://github.com/in-toto/witness/blob/main/docs/policy.md

### Sign the Policy file

Before signing, you need to replace the variables in the Policy file.

```bash
id=`sha256sum witness-demo-pub.pem | awk '{print $1}'` && sed -i "s/{{PUBLIC_KEY_ID}}/$id/g" policy.json

pubb64=`cat witness-demo-pub.pem | base64 -w 0` && sed -i "s/{{B64_PUBLIC_KEY}}/$pubb64/g" policy.json
```

Then use `witness sign` to sign.

```bash
witness sign -f policy.json --signer-file-key-path witness-demo-key.pem --outfile policy-signed.json
INFO    Using config file: .witness.yaml
```

#### Verify that the binary file meets policy requirements

```bash
witness verify -f dist/witness_demo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl -a witness-demo-att.json -p policy-signed.json -k witness-demo-pub.pem
INFO    Using config file: .witness.yaml
INFO    Verification succeeded
INFO    Evidence:
INFO    0: witness-demo-att.json
```

## Conclusion

This is a demonstration of using Witness for Non-GitHub projects.

If your project code is on GitHub, the easiest and most popular way is to use the [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator), a tool provided by the [SLSA Framework](https://github.com/slsa-framework), and then use [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) to verify the Provenance.  You can refer to my previous article [Python and SLSA ðŸ’ƒ](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/2023/11/python-and-slsa/) for details.
