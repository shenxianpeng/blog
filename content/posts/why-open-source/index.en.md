  This article shares my growth and rewards from contributing to open source, including skill improvement, career development, and community contributions. There are three main reasons: 1. Open source makes your work truly visible. 2. Open source allows you to access better projects and people. 3. I want to be seen, and I want to make money.

Many friends ask me: Why spend so much free time on open source? Even after having a child, why sacrifice rest time and continue to invest in it?

For me, open source is something worth "dedicating myself to". There are roughly three reasons:

### 1. Open Source Makes Your Work Truly Visible

In a company, no matter how well you do, only your colleagues or superiors know. But if you need to find a new job, you only get recognized during the interview, and it might even depend on the interviewer's mood at the time.

But open source is different.

A good open-source project is, in itself, the most powerful resume. It publicly displays your abilities and achievements, and when looking for a new job, it's often more persuasive than saying a hundred words.

### 2. Open Source Allows You to Access Better Projects and People

Writing CRUD code in isolation might lead to a career stagnation at age 35. But open source allows you to see trends, learn best practices, and connect with better communities and developers.

For example, I often watch the CPython repository, see how they submit PRs, propose PEPs, discuss on Discourse, and how their CI/CD works.

Just learning their work style is incredibly beneficial.

Furthermore, spending time in English-speaking communities is an invisible help in improving English proficiency.


### 3. I Want to Be Seen, and I Want to Make Money

Over the past few years, I've created 4 GitHub organizations and over a dozen open-source projects, accumulating hundreds of stars and potentially tens of thousands of users.

This is almost four years of accumulated spare timeâ€”late nights after my child falls asleep, sacrificed weekends and sleep, powered by passion.

But so far, I've hardly made a cent from it.

However, this is a **form of intangible asset**.

It complements my day job: ideas from open source can be applied at work, and experience gained at work can feed back into open source.

More importantly, it keeps me in a state of continuous learning, maintaining a sense of value and being needed.

## My Open Source Journey

My first open-source contribution was **cpp-linter-action**. Someone asked in an Issue if they could contribute, which ignited my open-source journey.

After that, I was enthusiastic and created the **cpp-linter** organization and related projects. This project later became one of the most important C/C++ linter projects on GitHub.

With more capacity, I started thinking about new directions and created **commit-check**, which also gained some users.

From 2024 to this year, with the popularity of AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Cursor, I felt that three years of effort could be replaced in a few months.

But after using them for a while, I found that:

* AI can help people without programming experience quickly write runnable code;
* But writing a large, maintainable project relies heavily on more than just AI.

For example, my recent work on **Jenkins Explain Error Plugin**, although I'm not familiar with Java, I was able to write it with the help of AI. But after submitting it to the official Jenkins repository, the reviewer gave me a lot of comments.

This made me realize more clearly: **AI-generated content still needs human oversight.**

Another example, someone tried to use AI to refactor my Jenkins pipeline. After looking at it, I could only laugh: **That's a pile of garbage code.**

## Conclusion

Open source, for me, is not just a hobby, but a self-driven learning method and a long-term intangible asset.

* It makes me visible;
* It allows me to connect with better people and practices;
* It keeps me feeling valuable and competitive.

Even if I haven't made any money yet, I still think it's something worth "dedicating myself to".

Whether I will eventually be replaced by AI, I don't know. But I believe that only by constantly learning and adapting can I remain needed in this rapidly changing era.
