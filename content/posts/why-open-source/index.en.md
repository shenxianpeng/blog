title: Four Years of Open Source: 3 Unexpected Rewards
summary: |
  Some say open source is useless, yielding neither profit nor time efficiency.  However, after four years of dedication, I've discovered three unexpected rewards: increased visibility for my work, access to better people and projects, and a long-term valuable investment. These benefits are applicable to every developer.

Many friends have asked me: why spend so much free time on open source? Especially after having a child, why continue to sacrifice rest time?

Honestly, I've been on this open-source path for four years, and I've barely earned a dime. But the rewards it has brought me are far more lasting than money.
Today, I want to share three points: these aren't just for open-source contributors; every developer, and even every worker, can learn from them.

## 1. Make Your Work Truly Visible

In a company, no matter how well you perform, only your colleagues or superiors usually know.
When changing jobs, it still depends on the interviewer's mood and perspective.

But open source is different. A public project is a living resume.
It directly showcases your abilities, more persuasively than a self-introduction.

ðŸ‘‰  **Key takeaway:** Even without contributing to open source, you can make yourself visible by writing blog posts, creating technical documentation, and answering questions in communities. The visibility of your work is an intangible asset.

## 2. Connect with Better People and Projects

If you only write CRUD code in your small corner, your career might stagnate by the age of 35.
Open source has allowed me to continuously engage with trends, best practices, and meet more excellent developers.

For example, I regularly watch the **CPython** repository, learning how they write PRs, propose PEPs, and implement CI/CD.
Just learning these processes has been incredibly rewarding. Spending a lot of time in English-speaking communities has also gradually improved my English.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key takeaway:** Even without participating in open source, you can follow excellent projects or large company engineering practices to learn their workflows. Many "expert" habits can be replicated in your own work.

## 3. A Long-Term Valuable Investment

Over the past four years, I have created 4 GitHub organizations and over a dozen projects, accumulating tens of thousands of users and hundreds of stars.
These achievements were gained through late nights after my child went to sleep, compressed weekends, and sacrificed sleep.

Although I've hardly made any money, this is a **long-term asset**.
My open-source experience has allowed me to grow faster at work, and my work experience has in turn fed back into my open-source contributions.
More importantly, it keeps me in a state of continuous learning, preventing me from falling into a "lying flat" mentality.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key takeaway:** Whether it's open source, writing a public account, or trying a side hustle, it can be viewed as a long-term investment. You may not make money in the short term, but it accumulates reputation, skills, and opportunities.

## My Open Source Story (Short Version)

On April 26, 2021, I took my first step into open source with [**cpp-linter-action**](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action).  Then one day someone proactively offered to contribute in an Issue, and that moment ignited my open-source journey.

After that, I maintained several projects with Brendan (2bndy5), and I learned a lot from him. I really hope to meet him in person in the US someday.

Later, we created the [**cpp-linter**](https://github.com/cpp-linter) organization, and the project gradually developed into one of the most important C/C++ linter projects on GitHub.  Then I wrote [**commit-check**](https://github.com/commit-check/commit-check) and [**conventional-branch**](https://github.com/conventional-branch/conventional-branch), which also gained a group of users.

In 2024, AI tools exploded. I was once worried about being replaced, but practice has proven: AI can help people quickly write runnable code, but truly excellent open-source projects still require human refinement.
For example, when I wrote [**Jenkins Explain Error Plugin**](https://github.com/jenkinsci/explain-error-plugin), I quickly made a first version with the help of AI, but the reviewer's comments ultimately made me realize: **AI has become an indispensable tool in development, but what truly gives open source value is human oversight and refinement.**

## Finally

Open source, for me, is not just a hobby, but a long-term valuable investment.

It makes me visible;
It connects me with better people and practices;
It keeps me feeling valuable and competitive.

Even without direct financial returns, I still believe it's something worth "dying for".

As for whether AI will replace us? I'm not sure.
But I'm certain that only by constantly trying and adapting can we continue to be needed in this rapidly changing era.
