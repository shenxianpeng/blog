title: Four Years of Open Source: 3 Unexpected Rewards
summary: |
  Some say open source is useless, neither profitable nor worth the time. But after four years of dedication, I've discovered 3 unexpected rewards: getting my work truly seen, connecting with better people and projects, and building long-term value.  These rewards are applicable to every developer.

I've been asked: Why dedicate your free time to open source, especially after having children?

Frankly, open source is more than a hobby for me; it's a long-term value investment.  
While the direct financial return is almost nonexistent, the rewards it brings are far more lasting than money.  
Today, I want to share three points: these aren't just for open-source contributors; every developer, and even every professional, can learn from them.

## 1. Getting Your Work Truly Seen

In a company, our achievements are usually only known to colleagues or superiors.  
Open-source projects are different; they showcase your abilities and accomplishments to a wider technical community.  
This "visibility" is often more persuasive in career development than a few lines on a resume.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key takeaway:** Even without open source, you can build visibility by blogging, creating technical documentation, and sharing your knowledge in communities. This is also an intangible asset.

## 2. Connecting with Better People and Projects

Coding CRUD in isolation might lead to career stagnation by age 35. Open source has allowed me to continually learn about trends, best practices, and connect with excellent developers worldwide.  
For example, I regularly watch the **CPython** repository, learning how they write PRs, propose PEPs, and implement CI/CD.  
Learning these processes alone has been incredibly beneficial.  Long-term participation in the English-speaking community has also improved my English skills.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key takeaway:** Even without participating in open source, you can benefit from following excellent projects or large company engineering practices and applying their experiences to your daily work.

## 3. Building Long-Term Value

Over the past four years, I've created several GitHub organizations and over ten projects, accumulating tens of thousands of users and hundreds of stars.  
These achievements are the result of gradual accumulation during my free time.

Although there's no direct financial return, this is a form of **long-term asset**.  
Open-source experience and thinking help me grow faster in my work, and work experience in turn feeds back into my open-source contributions.  
More importantly, it keeps me in a state of continuous learning and exploration.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key takeaway:** Whether it's open source, writing articles, or side projects, these can be seen as long-term investments. They may not immediately generate revenue, but they build reputation, skills, and opportunities.

## My Open Source Story (Short Version)

In 2021, I took my first step into open source with [**cpp-linter-action**](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action). I didn't expect someone to proactively contribute via an Issue so quickly; that moment ignited my open-source journey.

Later, I collaborated with Brendan (2bndy5) on multiple projects and learned a lot from him.  
We also created [**cpp-linter**](https://github.com/cpp-linter), which has gradually become one of the important C/C++ linter projects on GitHub.

Later, I wrote [**commit-check**](https://github.com/commit-check/commit-check) and [**conventional-branch**](https://github.com/conventional-branch/conventional-branch), gaining a loyal user base.

In 2024, AI tools exploded. I initially worried they might replace some developers, but quickly realized that while AI can quickly generate runnable code, it's insufficient for building large, maintainable projects.  
For example, when writing the [**Jenkins Explain Error Plugin**](https://github.com/jenkinsci/explain-error-plugin), AI helped me quickly create the initial version, but getting the project into the official Jenkins ecosystem required reviewer feedback and manual refinement.  
This reinforced my belief that **AI is a powerful tool, but ultimately, value comes from human thinking and judgment.**

## Conclusion

Open source has allowed me to:  

* Be seen by more people;  
* Connect with better people and practices;  
* Maintain a state of continuous learning and growth.  

Even without direct financial rewards, I still believe it's something worth pursuing.  

As for whether AI will replace us? Perhaps someday it will.

But for now, it's far from time to "lie flat".

**Continuous learning and adaptation are key to maintaining value and competitiveness in this rapidly changing world.**
