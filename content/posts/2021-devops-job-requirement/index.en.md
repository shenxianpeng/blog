## Preface

Since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic, more and more IT companies have completely switched to WFH (Work From Home) companies due to the necessity of remote work. Therefore, for IT professionals, job opportunities will be global in the future.

If you intend to work for a multinational company and want to work with people from all over the world, you cannot just focus on these large domestic companies. You need to broaden your horizons to the whole world and see what the requirements are for engineers at these well-known companies.

Today, let's take a look at the requirements for DevOps positions. Understanding these requirements will help us establish a learning direction in 2021.  Furthermore, if you intend to work for these companies, understanding and preparing in advance will increase your chances of securing your desired position.

Since the descriptions and requirements for these positions are lengthy, I'll start with the conclusions.

## Key Skills

* Many foreign companies primarily use AWS as their cloud provider, so familiarity and proficiency with AWS are essential.
* Proficiency in using DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Ansible (Chef), and Git.
* Docker and Kubernetes are essential for anyone wanting to pursue a DevOps career.
* Familiarity with operating systems, at least Linux.
* Most positions require strong Python skills; more senior roles often require familiarity with Go and Java.
* Finally, a willingness to learn, a proactive attitude, and creative thinking are the most important qualities for any DevOps engineer.  New technologies and tools are constantly emerging, so we need to keep up with our peers.
