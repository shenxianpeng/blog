Yesterday, some people may have encountered the inability to access GitHub.

Some people joked online that it was because of increased tariffs from the US, and GitHub's response code upgraded from 200 to 403.

Jokes aside, GitHub later provided an explanation—it was a configuration error, and the problem has now been fixed.

I recently returned to China for a trip, and once again experienced the convenience and affordability of express delivery, takeout, transportation, and payment. **The only inconvenience was the network.**

More accurately, it's the websites and services that many programmers rely on daily, such as GitHub, Docker Hub, Docker Desktop, and ChatGPT.  Of course, now we also have alternatives like DeepSeek.

In my personal experience, GitHub is accessible in China, but its stability is poor.  Often, it works when I first open it, but then completely fails to load after a while.

Outside of work, I already have limited free time in the evenings, but I often have to spend that time troubleshooting network problems.

While I know I can modify my hosts file or try other methods to circumvent network restrictions, setting it up on my computer has always been problematic.

All this troubleshooting is exhausting. Sometimes I don't even want to turn on my computer anymore; I just want to lie down and scroll through my phone.

My patience with accessing GitHub is wearing thin.

Oh well, I'll just take it as a break.
