Hello everyone! Since my last post [announcing the start of maintaining **gitstats**](../gitstats/), I've been continuously improving this project. Here are the major updates over the past two months:

## âœ¨ New Features and Improvements



1. **Support for Generating JSON Files**
   In addition to the original HTML report, gitstats can now generate JSON files!
   **Use Case**: Facilitates secondary development or programmatic use for developers, meeting more customized needs.
   **Origin**: This feature was implemented quickly based on user feedback.

2. **Code Refactoring**
   A significant amount of refactoring and optimization has been performed on the previously mixed code.
   **Benefits**: The code structure is clearer and easier to maintain, laying the foundation for writing unit tests.

3. **Replacing getopt**
   The deprecated `getopt` has been replaced with the more modern **argparse**.
   **Advantages**: Improves code readability and maintainability.

4. **Cross-Platform Support**
   In addition to Linux, gitstats has now been fully tested on **Windows** and **macOS**.
   **Testing**: I've conducted thorough testing on all three platforms to ensure real-time availability.

## ðŸ“… Next Steps

1. **Support for Theme Switching**
   In addition to the default theme, I plan to add a **Dark Mode**, catering to different user visual preferences.

2. **Unit Testing and Coverage**
   Unit tests will be added, and coverage will be increased to **100%** (a small goal) to prevent regression bugs.
