Many people may be curious about the daily work of a DevOps engineer. Today, I'll briefly share my daily routine as a DevOps/Build/Release engineer.

## Work Preparation

I arrive at the office at 9:30 AM. The first thing I do is check Slack and email, prioritizing urgent or easily answered messages. For more complex issues, I set reminders to avoid overlooking them.  Then, I add the day's tasks to my To-Do list and check Jenkins for any failed jobs requiring attention. This whole process takes about half an hour.


## Coffee Time

Around 10:00 AM is coffee time—the official start of the day. If there's a stand-up meeting at 10:30 AM, it's a quick review and planning session, mainly sharing yesterday's progress, today's tasks, and syncing up on everyone's status.

## Daily Work

After starting work, I open VSCode and continue with unfinished tasks from the previous day.  My commonly used code repositories include `pipeline-library`, `ansible-playbook`, `docker-images`, and `infra`, which manage pipelines, automation scripts, containers, and infrastructure, respectively.  I usually make updates or optimizations to these repositories daily.

Build and Release are also major parts of my work. Build tasks are automated; team members build independently using Multibranch Pipeline. I mainly handle branch management, merging and conflict resolution during releases, ensuring the accuracy of release information and version compliance.

In addition, there are some daily tasks, such as:

* Maintaining and upgrading the build environment
* Collecting code coverage and generating reports
* Upgrading compilers and handling related issues
* Managing virtual machine allocation and helping the team solve environment problems

The main work in the morning is responding to messages and handling problems, followed by tackling my To-Do list one by one.

## Lunch and Break

Around 12:30 PM, I have lunch with colleagues. Chatting during lunch is also a chance to practice English. Afterward, sometimes I go for a walk with colleagues nearby, or I go for a run myself.

## Afternoon

The afternoon is the main productive time. From 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM, I focus on the tasks on my To-Do list, trying to make progress. After 4:30 PM, my US colleagues come online, and there might be meetings or discussions about requirements.

## Evening Time

Evenings are family time. As the weather gets colder, it's not convenient to take the children out for walks, so we occasionally go grocery shopping. If the children are reading books or watching cartoons by themselves, I'll use the time to contribute to the open-source community or write articles.

This is a day in my life as a DevOps engineer, balancing work, family, and hobbies. I hope this little sharing will help you better understand the daily routine of this role.
