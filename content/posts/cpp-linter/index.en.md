This article shares practical experience with C/C++ code formatting and static analysis.

Currently, the most widely used tools for C/C++ code formatting and checking are [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) and [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) from the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) project.

> The LLVM project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.

For C/C++ code formatting and static analysis, we use clang-format and clang-tidy from the LLVM project; together, we call them clang-tools.

Although we have the tools, **how to better integrate the tools into our workflow** is the focus of this article.

The [cpp-linter](https://github.com/cpp-linter) organization was created to provide a one-stop workflow for C/C++ code formatting and static analysis, including:

1. Easy download of clang-tools, providing both Docker images and binaries;
2. Easy integration with workflows, including integration with CI and git hooks.

Below is how to use clang-tools, download tools, and integrate them into your workflow.



## clang-tools Docker images

If you want to use clang-format and clang-tidy via Docker, the [clang-tools](https://github.com/clang-tools) project provides Docker images specifically for this purpose.

Just download the clang-tools Docker image, and you can use clang-format and clang-tidy. For example:

```bash
# Check clang-format version
$ docker run xianpengshen/clang-tools:12 clang-format --version
Ubuntu clang-format version 12.0.0-3ubuntu1~20.04.4

# Format code (helloworld.c is in the demo directory of the repository)
$ docker run -v $PWD:/src xianpengshen/clang-tools:12 clang-format --dry-run -i helloworld.c

# Check clang-tidy version
$ docker run xianpengshen/clang-tools:12 clang-tidy --version
LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 12.0.0

  Optimized build.
  Default target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: cascadelake
# Diagnose code (helloworld.c is in the demo directory of the repository)
$ docker run -v $PWD:/src xianpengshen/clang-tools:12 clang-tidy helloworld.c \
-checks=boost-*,bugprone-*,performance-*,readability-*,portability-*,modernize-*,clang-analyzer-cplusplus-*,clang-analyzer-*,cppcoreguidelines-*
```

## clang-tools binaries

If you need to use clang-tools binaries, taking Windows as an example, downloading a specific version of clang-tools usually requires installing the large LLVM package first to obtain tools like clang-format & clang-tidy; it's much easier on Linux, where you can use commands to download, but downloading specific versions of clang-format & clang-tidy might require manual download and installation.

[clang-tools-pip](https://github.com/clang-tools-pip) provides and supports downloading any specified version of clang-tools executables on Windows, Linux, and macOS via the command line.

Simply install `clang-tools` using `pip` (i.e., `pip install clang-tools`), and then you can install any version of the executable using the `clang-tools` command.

For example, to install clang-tools version 13:

`$ clang-tools --install 13`

You can also install it to a specific directory:

`$ clang-tools --install 13 --directory .`

After successful installation, you can check the installed version:

```bash
$ clang-format-13 --version
clang-format version 13.0.0

$ clang-tidy-13 --version
LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 13.0.0
  Optimized build.
  Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: skylake
```

The `clang-tools` CLI also provides other options, such as automatically creating links for you.  Check its CLI [documentation](https://cpp-linter.github.io/clang-tools-pip/cli_args.html) for help.

## Integrating clang-tools into your workflow

We've introduced two convenient ways to download clang-tools: Docker images and binaries.  How to integrate them into your workflow is our ultimate concern.

Mainstream IDEs can use clang-format and clang-tidy via plugins, but this has problems:

1. Different developers may use different IDEs, requiring a high learning cost to install plugins on different IDEs;
2. It cannot guarantee that all developers will run Clang-Format or Clang-Tidy when submitting code.

So how can we ensure that Clang-Format or Clang-Tidy is run every time code is submitted?

1. [cpp-linter-action](https://github.com/cpp-linter-action) provides CI checks. If unformatted code or diagnostic errors are found, the CI will fail, preventing code that hasn't passed code checks from being merged into the main branch;
2. [cpp-linter-hooks](https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks) uses git hooks to automatically run clang-format and clang-tidy when code is submitted.  If the code doesn't meet the standards, the submission fails, and a prompt appears with automatic formatting.

## cpp-linter-action for Automatic Checks Before Code Merge

If you're using GitHub, we highly recommend using the [cpp-linter-action](https://github.com/cpp-linter-action) GitHub Action.

> Currently, [cpp-linter](https://github.com/cpp-linter) does not have API integration with SCMs other than GitHub.

Here are some of its key features:

1. Results are displayed using Annotations and Thread Comments.
2. Supports GitHub's public and private repositories.
3. Supports most Clang versions.
4. Many other [optional-inputs](https://github.com/cpp-linter-action#optional-inputs) are available.

To use this Action, simply create a `cpp-linter.yml` file under `.github/workflows/`, with the following content:

> Of course, you can also add the following configuration to an existing Workflow, such as build.

```yaml
name: cpp-linter

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  push:

jobs:
  cpp-linter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: cpp-linter-action@v1
        id: linter
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          style: file

      - name: Fail fast?!
        if: steps.linter.outputs.checks-failed > 0
        run: |
          echo "Some files failed the linting checks!"
          exit 1
```

If unformatted code or static code analysis errors are found, the CI workflow will fail, and the following comments will appear; annotations are enabled by default.

If the Thread Comment option (`thread-comments: true`) is enabled, the following error comments will be automatically added to the Pull Request.

Many well-known projects already depend on this Action, and its ranking in the GitHub Marketplace is very high; you can use it with confidence.

> Note: The annotations and comment features currently only support GitHub. This project plans to support other SCMs like Bitbucket and GitLab in the future.

## cpp-linter-hooks for Automatic Checks on Code Submission

[cpp-linter-hooks](https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks) uses git hooks for automatic checks on code submission; this method is not limited to any SCM.

Just add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file to your project repository, then add the [cpp-linter-hooks](https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks) hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, as follows:

> `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is the default configuration file for the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

1. Install pre-commit

    ```python
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Create the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file, setting it as follows:

    ```yaml
    repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks
      rev: v0.2.1
      hooks:
        - id: clang-format
          args: [--style=file]  # to load .clang-format
        - id: clang-tidy
          args: [--checks=.clang-tidy] # path/to/.clang-tidy
    ```

    > Here, `file` refers to `.clang-format`. clang-format supports LLVM, GNU, Google, Chromium, Microsoft, Mozilla, and WebKit encoding formats by default. If you need special settings, you can create a `.clang-format` configuration file in the root directory of your repository. Similarly, if the default static analysis settings do not meet your requirements, you can create a `.clang-tidy` configuration file in the root directory of the repository.

    For more configurations, see the [README](https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks).

3. Install the git hook script

    ```bash
    $ pre-commit install
    pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

4. After this, every `git commit` will automatically run clang-format and clang-tidy.

    If unformatted code or static analysis errors are detected, the following error message will appear:

    clang-format output

    ```bash
    clang-format.............................................................Failed
    - hook id: clang-format
    - files were modified by this hook
    ```

    And it will automatically format your code:

    ```diff
    --- a/testing/main.c
    +++ b/testing/main.c
    @@ -1,3 +1,6 @@
    #include <stdio.h>
    -int main() {for (;;) break; printf("Hello world!\n");return 0;}
    -
    +int main() {
    +  for (;;) break;
    +  printf("Hello world!\n");
    +  return 0;
    +}
    ```

    clang-tidy output

    ```bash
    clang-tidy...............................................................Failed
    - hook id: clang-tidy
    - exit code: 1

    418 warnings and 1 error generated.

    ```

## Conclusion

CI or git hooks?

* If your team is already using pre-commit, we recommend using git hooks. Just add [cpp-linter-hooks](https://github.com/cpp-linter-hooks).
* If you don't want to introduce pre-commit, you can use CI for checking.  Of course, you can also choose both.

The cpp-linter organization is an open-source project I created and maintained by [Brendan Doherty](https://github.com/2bndy5) and me as the primary contributors. We are developers who pursue code quality and strive to build the best software.  I've spent a lot of my free time on it, but I've also learned a lot. I'll share some interesting implementation methods later.

Currently, cpp-linter provides the best C/C++ Linter Action and clang-tools on GitHub.  We welcome your use, and you can provide feedback on any suggestions or problems through Issues.
