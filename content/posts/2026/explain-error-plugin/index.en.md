Thanks to your feedback and contributions, the **Explain Error Plugin** has recently added two very practical features:

1.  **Support for specifying the output language for explanations**
2.  **Support for obtaining return values in a Pipeline for programmatic use**

This update makes the plugin more powerful and user-friendly in multilingual support and automation scenarios. ([GitHub][1])

## I. Support for specifying the output language for explanations (PR #76)

### Background and Functionality

Previously, the error explanations generated by the plugin were in English by default, which was not very user-friendly for non-English speakers.
With PR #76, we have **added an optional `language` parameter** to `explainError()`, allowing users to specify the language in which they wish to receive error explanations. ([GitHub][1])

This means you can have AI explain Jenkins build failure logs in Chinese, Japanese, or other languages, making it more aligned with your team's language habits (e.g., a Chinese development team getting explanations directly in Chinese).

### How to Use

You can use it in a Jenkins Pipeline like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'  // Simulate build process
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            // Specify language as Chinese
            explainError(language: '中文')
        }
    }
}
```

It can also be used for different languages:

```groovy
explainError(language: '日本語')
```

The plugin automatically passes this language information to the AI prompt, allowing the AI to generate error explanations in the specified language. ([GitHub][1])

## II. Support for return values for programmatic use in Pipeline (PR #77)

### Background and Functionality

In some scenarios, we want to **not only see the error explanation content appear in the Jenkins UI, but also retrieve this content within the Pipeline script for further processing** (e.g., sending notifications, emails, pushing to chat tools, etc.).

PR #77 adds this enhancement: the `explainError()` step can now **return a string result**, making it convenient to save the explanation content to a variable and use it in the Pipeline. ([GitHub][2])

### How to Use Return Values

Example Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            script {
                // Get explanation content
                def explanation = explainError(language: '中文')
                echo "AI 解释结果：${explanation}"

                // Further processing with the explanation
                // For example, sending to Slack or email
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This way, you not only see the AI explanation in the sidebar but can also integrate it further into your own processes. ([GitHub][2])

## Summary

| Feature                 | Description                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 Multilingual Support | Allows AI explanations to be returned in a specified language (Chinese, Japanese, etc.) via the `language:` parameter. |
| 🔁 Return Value Support | Explanation content can be returned as a Pipeline step value for automated processing. |

These two enhancements make the Explain Error Plugin **more flexible, internationalized, and suitable for more complex CI/CD workflows**. If you want error explanations to better align with your team's language or automate integration with notification systems, this update will greatly improve your experience! ([GitHub][1])

Update to the latest version and try out these new features! If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub. Happy CI/CD! 🚀
