I was fortunate enough to benefit from my company's policy change, giving me 12 weeks of paternity leave to be a full-time dad. While taking care of my family, I hoped to find time for learning, especially since having nearly 3 months of leave is a rare opportunity during employment.

Balancing childcare and learning is not easy. I tried my best to manage both and kept a detailed record.

## Plan

Knowing that 12 weeks would pass quickly, I decided to plan my tasks after the first two weeks had already passed.  My plan included:

- [ ] Complete reading and writing Douban reviews for *Clean Code*, *Refactoring*, and *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*.
- [ ] Write a `cpp-linter-hooks` for pre-commit that integrates clang-format and clang-tidy.
- [ ] Complete 15 English lessons and 3-4 physical exercise sessions (swimming and football) per month.
- [ ] Find a long-term open-source project to contribute to, such as pytest, tox, or pypa.


From the second week of my leave, I started recording my weekly progress.


## Weekly Reports

Weeks 11-12 (August 15th - August 28th) - The final two weeks

Time flew by, and before I knew it, it was the last two weeks of my leave.

- Validated VMs
- Updated documentation on the use of `setuptools_scm`.
- Made some project modifications and code reviews in the cpp-linter organization.

Week 10 (August 8th - August 14th) - The final three weeks

- Validated VMs
- Summarized the use of `setuptools_scm`.

Week 9 (August 1st - August 7th) - Time flies; it's the final four weeks of paternity leave.

- Drafted an article about contributing to open source.
- Did some troubleshooting support; participated in open-source projects and code reviews.
- Went swimming and completed the book review for *Refactoring*.

Week 8 (July 25th - July 31st)

- Updated some projects in `cpp-linter`, migrated and tested Artifactory.
- Didn't complete many planned tasks this week, such as writing articles and reading.
- Went swimming.

Week 7 (July 18th - July 24th)

- Discovered that Python is easy to learn but hard to master... I learned the basics of tox and mypy and will try using them in future projects.
- Refactored some code; I intended to reach 100% code coverage, but didn't achieve it.  I still need to continue learning pytest.
- I'm brainstorming an interesting project for long-term spare time; I have a rough idea and will try it out.
- Didn't read much of *Refactoring*; I'll continue swimming on Saturdays.

Week 6 (July 11th - July 17th)

- Completed the development of the `cpp-linter-hooks` feature and migrated it to the cpp-linter organization.
- Created a `.github` repository. This is a powerful and versatile tool for organizations; I'm still exploring its capabilities.
- Finally submitted the book review for *Clean Code*; I need to continue reading to complete the task.
- Published an article on WeChat on Friday (it was an older article that I finally finished editing). This was my first update in 3 months.
- Went swimming on Sunday.

Week 5 (July 4th - July 10th)

- Last week, I spent time writing the `clang-tools-pip` and `cpp-linter-hooks` features; they are about 70% complete, and I expect to finish them this week.
- Also spent some time on work, fixing a few issues in a previously written pipeline.
- Started reading *Refactoring* last week, but didn't have much time for reading. I wanted to update my WeChat article, but it took a long time.
- Didn't go swimming last Sunday because I hurt my neck, possibly from feeding the baby and looking down :(

Weeks 3-4:

- *Clean Code* pages 56-130
- To implement `cpp-linter-hooks`, I needed to implement installing clang-tools with pip; therefore, I created `clang-tools-pip`.
- Went swimming at the city swimming pool once; a second planned swim was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.

Week 2:

- *Clean Code* pages 26-56
- Created the `cpp-linter-hooks` repository; studied other people's code.
- Planned to go swimming with Coach Qiao this weekend.
