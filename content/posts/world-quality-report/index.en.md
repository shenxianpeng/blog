The World Quality Report (WQR) is a unique global study, this year’s survey highlights the impact of evolving pandemic-influenced application demands in newly deployed methods, and the adoption of QA into Agile and DevOps practices, the continued rise of AI.

Focusing on such software quality reports as this helps us quickly understand the current state and trends in the software testing industry.

## Five Key Themes

A key message from the WQR: In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we see the convergence of digital transformation and the real-time adoption of Agile and DevOps practices.  Furthermore, QA is emerging as a leader in the adoption of Agile and DevOps practices, providing teams with the tools and processes to promote quality throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The WQR highlights five specific themes around key findings and trends:

1. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on QA organizations and software testing
2. Real-time convergence of digital transformation and DevOps and Agile adoption and the increasingly important role of QA
3. Geographically dispersed teams focusing on business outcomes when deploying applications across environments
4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhancing Agile and DevOps fostering a growing culture of quality accountability across all teams
5. Utilizing AI-driven continuous testing and quality management tools to address customer experience priorities and rapidly changing pandemic-influenced requirements



## Key Findings and Trends

### 1. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on QA organizations and software testing

The COVID-19 pandemic had a direct and tangible impact on nearly all aspects of business, including QA.  However, many QA organizations were able to adapt to the realities of new hybrid work environments and transition to the new reality of working in distributed teams. This may have happened because the trend towards hybrid distributed teams was already growing, and the pandemic simply accelerated this trend.

#### Customer Experience is King

The COVID-19 pandemic refocused attention on the customer and their experience. The top-rated aspects this year were:

* Enhanced customer experience, selected by 63% of respondents
* Followed by enhanced security (62%)
* Then higher responsiveness to business needs (61%)
* And higher-quality software solutions (61%)

#### From Custodian to Quality Champion

Testing and QA goals have also been reordered in the past year. Last year, business outcome and quality guardians were clear leaders, while this year the support rate between these metrics has narrowed.

* Quality custodians, quality velocity, and quality empowerment within the team lead at 62%
* Business assurance, digital wellbeing, and automation came in second at 61%

QA teams are evolving from guardians of quality to champions of quality. QA teams are becoming vibrant leaders in organizational quality initiatives, empowering everyone on the team to achieve quality while contributing to business outcomes and growth.

### 2. Real-time convergence of digital transformation and DevOps and Agile adoption and the increasingly important role of QA

#### Driving Digital Transformation

This year, digital transformation initiatives aligned with pandemic requirements. Before the pandemic began, Agile and DevOps were a growing trend. During the pandemic, we began to see QA now playing a key role in organizational adoption of Agile and DevOps, blurring the lines between development and testing while creating a blended approach to quality.

Let's look at what drives digital transformation: Increasing productivity and efficiency leads at 47%; followed by improving service/product quality at 46%; third is speed, better agility and flexibility; customer experience directly follows speed; closely followed by cost reduction and creating innovative opportunities; competitive differentiation is last.

> Because competitive differentiation seems to be more of a side benefit of digital transformation, whereas digital transformation itself helps improve efficiency, quality, speed and overall better customer experience.

#### Increasing Role of QA in DevOps and Agile Adoption – Guided by Business Priorities

This year, we witnessed a significant adjustment in business needs, becoming more important than the needs of the tech stack. Compared to last year, the number of participants weighting the tech stack dropped by 16 percentage points, replaced by the biggest increases:

* Business priorities, now ranked first, increased by 11 percentage points compared to last year
* Also significantly increased compared to last year is culture/agility, increasing by 21 percentage points

### 3. Geographically dispersed teams focusing on business outcomes when deploying applications across environments

Last year's survey was conducted at the beginning of the global pandemic, revealing signs of change needed to meet business goals, and new requirements for remote work and digital transformation. Through this year's survey, we see digital transformation continuing even while keeping pace with pandemic-influenced new work requirements. This accelerated companies' plans to migrate workloads to the cloud, partly driven by planned digital transformation initiatives, and the rapid shift to remote work, stimulating the need for increased security.

Due to pandemic-influenced workplaces, the highest-rated focus was on remote access to testing systems and testing environments (using SaaS and cloud). Supporting this remote access are secondary factors based on remote including better team collaboration tools. In order to support the quality of modern applications, testing environments must also be modernized. This year, we see:

* Organizations increasingly satisfied with using cloud and containers to modernize testing environments (highest satisfaction)
* Followed by improved booking and management of test environments (+16)
* Then providing visibility (+22)
* And finally cost efficiency (+18)

### 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhancing Agile and DevOps fostering a growing culture of quality accountability across all teams

Artificial intelligence continues to change how test automation is built, and how testing is performed. We see growing confidence in the level of AI-based testing within organizations, with nearly half of respondents stating that they already possess the repository of test execution data needed for AI and ML, and stating that they are willing to act on the intelligence provided by their AI and ML platforms.

This year, we also asked respondents to predict their likelihood of utilizing a range of approaches to accelerate and optimize testing within Agile and DevOps environments. Compared to the same period last year:

* Automated quality gates integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines (+5)
* Implementing intelligent and automated dashboards to enable continuous quality monitoring grew the most (+9)
* Newly added this year, the use of AI to optimize test cases ranked second overall, only behind shift-left testing.

### 5. Utilizing AI-driven continuous testing and quality management tools to address customer experience priorities and rapidly changing pandemic-influenced requirements

This year, we asked respondents about the benefits of test automation:

* First, all items show a year-over-year trend of decline compared to last year, showing the challenges faced in working in hybrid and distributed teams
* Such as better defect discovery, shorter test cycles, lower overall security risks, better test coverage, lower testing costs, and control over test transparency are all obvious benefits
* AI/ML is the fourth highest benefit, also demonstrating its potential and value

## Key Recommendations

### QA Orchestration in Agile and DevOps

Focus on what matters most: customer experience and business goals, meeting both with efficiency and speed. Simultaneously, embrace engineering thinking within your teams and accept multi-skilling and upskilling. A new trend rapidly becoming the new norm is SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test). Invest in insights, especially real-time insights across the entire QA and testing function. Focus on developing intelligent dashboards with real-time KPIs, from short-term tactical plans to long-term planning and strategic direction.

### Intelligent Test Automation

Standardize the use of test automation within QA by adopting an automation-first approach to software quality delivery. Extend automation across the E2E lifecycle, incorporating automation into all QA activities.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Drive the use of AI – don’t be driven by it. AI and ML promise exponential improvements, but use AI as a tool, not a replacement for the business decisions you are making. For example, use AI to illuminate what to do and when to do it. It not only helps identify failures, but helps identify the reasons why these failures are occurring. Furthermore, focus AI on what matters most, identifying the most challenging quality areas in software delivery. If you haven’t incorporated AI into quality, now is the best time to start.

### Test Environment Management (TEM) and Test Data Management (TDM)

Cloud adoption is continuing to show definite and steady growth, but be mindful of ensuring that the future doesn’t overshadow the needs of the present. The key to successful cloud adoption is to ensure integrity with legacy applications.  Additionally, data analytics is now a key aspect of a test data management framework.

### Security and Smart Industries

Remote connectivity requires appropriate consideration of security and resilience for testing and QA organizations. Invest in innovation, in your labs and in your teams. Whether you start with a POC to prove feasibility, ensuring management support is key to implementing change.
