What kind of technical skills and experience define a senior engineer? Let me share my perspective on a senior engineer.

### Extensive Industry Testing Experience

Ideally, experience in both traditional and internet companies is preferred.  If not, at least engage with senior test engineers from these companies to understand their testing methodologies; this will broaden your horizons.


### Strong Testing Fundamentals

Master essential testing theories, be familiar with testing processes, requirements analysis, and test case design methods.  Develop test plans based on project needs.

### Strong Business Acumen

Proficient functional testing requires a deep understanding of the business.  This allows you to design test cases from the product perspective, uncovering issues beyond basic functionality and providing constructive feedback and suggestions to the product team.

### Familiarity with Relevant Testing Tools

Many tools are used in software testing. Understanding and having experience with these tools allows you to better weigh which tools to introduce based on company requirements and project needs, ultimately improving efficiency.

1. Management Tools:  Such as JIRA, Testlink, Wiki, Confluence
2. Continuous Integration: Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis CI, etc. Understand their differences and implementation.
3. Automated Testing: How to perform automated testing across web and mobile platforms, and which tools to use.  Understanding Selenium, WebDriver, Appium, Robotium testing frameworks, and which languages to use for developing automated test cases: Python? Java? JavaScript?  Knowing how to choose and implement.
4. Performance Testing: Understanding Jmeter and LoadRunner, two major performance testing tools, and how to conduct performance testing.

### Strong Coding Ability

Strong coding skills enable rapid mastery of automated testing and even the development of testing platforms.  Furthermore, when switching jobs, this allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with automated test cases written in Java, Python, Javascript, or any other language.

### Language Skills

This includes communication and foreign language skills. Communication is an essential skill for testers. Good communication ensures developers understand the issues and accept your suggestions, and allows you to better understand requirements from product personnel. While English is only essential in foreign companies, testers also need to learn many technical skills.  With the growth of the open-source community, much primary information is in English, so learning English is very helpful for expanding and learning new knowledge.

Therefore, becoming an excellent senior test engineer requires many skills. Let's work hard together! ðŸ’ª
