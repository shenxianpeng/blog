## DevOps Terminology and Definitions

1. What is DevOps?

    In the simplest terms, DevOps is the grey area between the Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) teams in the product development process. DevOps is a culture that emphasizes communication, integration, and collaboration in the product development lifecycle.  Therefore, it eliminates the silos between software development and operations teams, enabling them to integrate and deploy products rapidly and continuously.

2. What is Continuous Integration?

    Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where team members frequently integrate their work, using automated tests to verify and assert that their code doesn't conflict with the existing codebase. Ideally, code changes should be automatically built (including compile, release, automated testing) on every commit with the help of CI tools daily, allowing early detection of integration errors to ensure that merged code doesn't break the main branch.

3. What is Continuous Delivery?

    Continuous Delivery (CD), along with Continuous Integration, provides a complete flow for delivering code packages. At this stage, automated build tools will be used to compile artifacts and make them ready for delivery to end-users. Its goal is to make software building, testing, and releasing faster and more frequent. This approach reduces the cost and time of software development, minimizing risks.

4. What is Continuous Deployment?

    Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery to the next level by integrating new code changes and automatically delivering them to the release branch. More specifically, once updates pass all stages of the production process, they are deployed directly to end-users without any human intervention.  Therefore, to successfully leverage continuous deployment, software artifacts must first pass rigorously established automated tests and tools before being deployed to production environments.

5. What is Continuous Testing and its benefits?

    Continuous testing is the practice of applying automated tests early, often, and appropriately throughout the software delivery pipeline. In a typical CI/CD workflow, releases are built in small batches. Therefore, it's impractical to manually execute test cases for each delivery. Automated continuous testing eliminates manual steps and turns them into automated routines, thereby reducing human effort.  Therefore, automated continuous testing is vital for a DevOps culture.

    Benefits of Continuous Testing:

    * Ensures quality and speed of builds.
    * Supports faster software delivery and continuous feedback mechanisms.
    * Detects bugs as soon as they appear in the system.
    * Reduces business risks.  Assesses potential issues before they become actual problems.

6. What is Version Control and its uses?

    Version control (or source code control) is a repository where all changes in the source code are always stored. Version control provides an operational history of code development, faithfully recording information such as file changes, time, and person. Version control is the source of continuous integration and continuous building.

7. What is Git?

    Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in a code repository. Leveraging GitHub flow, Git revolves around a branch-based workflow that simplifies team collaboration as team projects evolve.

## Reasons for Implementing DevOps

8. Why is DevOps important? How does DevOps benefit teams in software delivery?

    In today's digital world, organizations must reshape their product deployment systems to be more robust and agile to keep pace with the competition.

    This is where the DevOps concept comes in. DevOps plays a vital role in generating mobility and agility for the entire software development pipeline, from conception to deployment to the end-user. DevOps is a solution that integrates a more streamlined and efficient process for continuously updating and improving products.

9. Explain how DevOps helps developers.

    In a world without DevOps, the developer workflow would start with building new code, delivering and integrating them, then the operations team is responsible for packaging and deploying the code. After that, they would have to wait for feedback. And if something goes wrong, they would have to execute it again due to errors. Along the line is countless manual communications between different teams involved in the project.

    By applying DevOps, developers' tasks can be simplified to only building code, as CI/CD practices have merged and automated the rest of the tasks. Combining engineering and operations teams helps establish better communication and collaboration as the processes become more transparent and accessible to all team members.

10. Why has DevOps become increasingly popular in software delivery recently?

    DevOps has gained traction in the last few years primarily due to its ability to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes of organizational operations, translating them into business value.

    Technological advancements are rapid.  Therefore, organizations must adopt a new workflow – DevOps and Agile methodologies – to streamline and stimulate their operations rather than lagging behind other companies. The capabilities of DevOps are clearly demonstrated by the success achieved by Facebook and Netflix's continuous deployment approach, which successfully fueled their growth without disrupting ongoing operations.

11. What are the benefits of CI/CD?

    The combination of CI and CD unifies all code changes into a single repository and runs them through automated tests, resulting in a comprehensively developed product at all stages, ready for deployment at any time.

    CI/CD enables organizations to roll out product updates quickly, efficiently, and automatically, as expected by customers.

    In short, a well-planned and executed CI/CD pipeline speeds up release velocity and reliability while mitigating code changes and defects in products. This will ultimately lead to higher customer satisfaction.

12. What are the benefits of Continuous Delivery?

    By manually releasing code changes, the team has complete control over the product. In certain circumstances, a new version of the product will be more promising: a promotional strategy with a clear business purpose.

    By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, IT professionals can have more thinking power to focus on improving the product without worrying about integration progress.

13. What are the benefits of Continuous Deployment?

    With continuous deployment, developers can focus entirely on the product as their final task in the pipeline is to review pull requests and merge them into the branch. This approach enables rapid deployment and reduces deployment duration by releasing new features and fixes immediately after automated tests.

    The customer will be the one assessing the quality of each release. Bug fixes in new versions are easier to handle as each version is now delivered in small batches.

## How to Effectively Implement DevOps

14. Define a typical DevOps workflow.

    A typical DevOps workflow can be simplified into 4 stages:

    * Version Control: This is the stage where source code is stored and managed. Version control contains different versions of the code.
    * Continuous Integration: In this step, developers start building components, compile, verify them, then test them through code reviews, unit tests, and integration tests.
    * Continuous Delivery: This is the next level of continuous integration where the release and testing processes are fully automated. CD ensures that new releases are delivered quickly and sustainably to end-users.
    * Continuous Deployment: After the application successfully passes all testing requirements, it is automatically deployed to the production server for release without any human intervention.

15. What are the core operations of DevOps?

    The core operations of DevOps in development and infrastructure are:

    Software development:

    * Code building
    * Code coverage
    * Unit testing
    * Packaging
    * Deployment

    Infrastructure:

    * Provisioning
    * Configuration
    * Orchestration
    * Deployment

16. What precautions should a team consider before implementing DevOps?

    There are some misconceptions about DevOps practices that can lead to disastrous failures when organizations try to apply this new methodology:

    * DevOps is not simply about applying new tools and/or forming new "departments" and expecting it to work. In reality, DevOps is considered a culture that development and operations teams follow a common framework.
    * Enterprises do not define a clear vision for their DevOps practice. Applying a DevOps plan is a significant change for both development and operations teams. Therefore, having a clear roadmap, goals, and expectations for integrating DevOps into your organization will eliminate any confusion and provide clear guidelines from the early stages.
    * After applying DevOps practices across the organization, the management team needs to establish a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Failures and problems in the system should be seen as valuable media for teams to learn from mistakes and prevent those mistakes from happening again.

17. What role does the SCM team play in DevOps?

    Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the practice of tracking and preserving records of the development environment, including all changes and adjustments made in the operating system.

    In DevOps, SCM is built as code under the umbrella of Infrastructure as Code practices.

    SCM simplifies tasks for developers as they no longer need to manually manage the configuration process. This process is now built in a machine-readable form and is automatically replicated and standardized.

18. What role does the Quality Assurance (QA) team play in DevOps?

    As DevOps practices become more popular in innovative organizations, the responsibilities and relevance of the QA team have shown signs of decline in today's automated world.

    However, this can be considered a myth. The increase of DevOps does not equate to the end of the QA role.  It only means that their working environment and required expertise are changing.  Therefore, their main focus is professional development to keep up with this ever-changing trend.

    In DevOps, the QA team plays a strategic role in ensuring the stability of continuous delivery practices and performing exploratory testing tasks that automated repetitive tests cannot accomplish. Their insights in evaluating and detecting the most valuable tests still play a crucial role in mitigating errors in the final steps of releases.

19. What tools are used in DevOps? Describe your experience using any of these tools.

    In a typical DevOps lifecycle, there are different tools to support different stages of product development. Therefore, the most commonly used tools for DevOps can be categorized into 6 key stages:

    Continuous Development: Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS, Jira
    Continuous Integration: Jenkins, Bamboo, CircleCI
    Continuous Delivery: Nexus, Archiva, Tomcat
    Continuous Deployment: Puppet, Chef, Docker
    Continuous Monitoring: Splunk, ELK Stack, Nagios
    Continuous Testing: Selenium, Katalon Studio

20. How to perform change management in DevOps practices?

    Typical change management methods need to be appropriately integrated with modern DevOps practices. The first step is to centralize changes into one platform to streamline change, problem, and event management processes.

    Next, enterprises should establish high transparency standards to ensure everyone is on the same page and ensure the accuracy of internal information and communications.

    Tiering upcoming changes and establishing a robust strategy will help minimize risks and shorten change cycles. Finally, organizations should apply automation to their processes and integrate with DevOps software.

## How to Effectively Implement CI/CD

21. What are some core components of CI/CD?

    A stable CI/CD pipeline requires a repository management tool that serves as a version control system. This allows developers to track changes in software versions.

    Within the version control system, developers can also collaborate on projects, compare between versions, and eliminate any errors they make, thus mitigating disruptions to all team members.

    Continuous testing and automated testing are two of the most crucial keys to successfully establishing a seamless CI/CD pipeline. Automated tests must be integrated into all product development stages (including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing) to cover all functionalities such as performance, usability, performance, load, stress, and security.

22. What are some common practices of CI/CD?

    Here are some best practices for establishing an effective CI/CD pipeline:

    * Develop a DevOps culture
    * Implement and utilize continuous integration
    * Deploy to each environment in the same way
    * Fail and restart the pipeline
    * Apply version control
    * Include the database in the pipeline
    * Monitor your continuous delivery process
    * Make your CD pipeline smooth

23. When is the best time to implement CI/CD?

    The transition to DevOps requires a thorough reshaping of its software development culture, including workflows, organizational structures, and infrastructure. Therefore, organizations must be prepared for the significant changes involved in implementing DevOps.

24. What are some common CI/CD servers?

    Visual Studio
    Visual Studio supports a complete DevOps system with agile planning, source control, package management, test and release automation, and continuous monitoring.

    TeamCity
    TeamCity is a smart CI server that provides framework support and code coverage without installing any additional plugins or requiring modules to build scripts.

    Jenkins
    It is a standalone CI server that supports collaboration between development and operations teams through shared pipelines and error tracking features. It can also be combined with hundreds of dashboard plugins.

    GitLab
    GitLab users can customize the platform for effective continuous integration and deployment. GitLab helps CI/CD teams accelerate the speed of code delivery, error identification, and recovery procedures.

    Bamboo
    Bamboo is a continuous integration server for automated product release management. Bamboo tracks all deployments across all tools and communicates errors in real-time.

25. Describe an effective workflow for continuous integration.

    A successful workflow for implementing continuous integration involves the following practices:

    * Implement and maintain a repository for project source code
    * Automate the build and integration
    * Make the build self-testing
    * Commit changes to the baseline every day
    * Build all commits added to the baseline
    * Keep builds quick
    * Run tests in a clone of the production environment
    * Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
    * Make build results easy to monitor for everyone
    * Automate deployment


## Differences Between Each Term

26. What are the main differences between Agile and DevOps?

    Essentially, DevOps and Agile are complementary. Agile is more focused on the values and principles of developing new software and managing complex processes more effectively. Meanwhile, DevOps aims to enhance communication, integration, and collaboration between different teams consisting of developers and operations teams.

    It takes both Agile and DevOps methodologies to form a seamlessly working product development lifecycle: Agile principles help shape and guide the right direction of development, while DevOps leverages tools to ensure complete delivery of the product to the customer.

27. What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?

    Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of continuously integrating code versions into a shared repository. This practice ensures that new code is automatically tested and allows for the quick detection and correction of bugs.

    Continuous Delivery takes CI a step further, ensuring that after integration, the codebase is ready to be released within a button's click at any time. Therefore, CI can be considered a prerequisite for continuous delivery, another important component of the CI/CD pipeline.

    For continuous deployment, no manual steps are required. Once the code passes testing, it is automatically pushed to the production environment.

    All three components: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are essential phases of implementing DevOps.

    Continuous delivery is better suited for applications where active users already exist, so things can slow down a bit and be better tuned. On the other hand, if you are going to release a completely new software and specify the entire process to be fully automated, then continuous deployment is a more suitable choice for your product.

28. What are the fundamental differences between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

    In Continuous Delivery, the code in the main branch is always deployable manually. With this practice, the development team can decide when to release new changes or features to maximize the benefits to the organization.

    Meanwhile, Continuous Deployment will automatically deploy all updates and patches in the code to the production environment immediately after the testing phase, without any human intervention.

29. What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?

    Continuous integration helps ensure that software components work together tightly. Integration should happen frequently; ideally hourly or daily. Continuous integration helps increase the frequency of code commits and reduces the complexity of connecting the code of multiple developers. Ultimately, this process reduces the chances of incompatible code and redundant work.

    Continuous delivery is the next step in the CI/CD process. As code is constantly integrated into a shared repository, that code can be continuously tested. There is no gap to perform testing while waiting for the code to be completed. This ensures that as many errors as possible are found and then continuously delivered to production.

30. What is the difference between DevOps and Continuous Delivery?

    DevOps is more of an organizational and cultural approach that promotes collaboration and communication between engineering and operations teams.

    Meanwhile, continuous delivery is a critical element of successfully implementing DevOps into the product development workflow. Continuous delivery practices help make new releases more mundane and reliable and establish a more seamless and shorter process.

    The main goal of DevOps is to effectively combine Dev and Ops roles, eliminate all silos, and achieve business goals independent of continuous delivery practices.

    On the other hand, continuous delivery works best if there are already DevOps processes in place.  Therefore, it expands collaboration and streamlines the unified product development cycle of the organization.

31. What are the differences between Agile, Lean IT, and DevOps?

    Agile is a methodology focused solely on software development. Agile aims for iterative development, establishing continuous delivery, shortening feedback loops, and improving team collaboration throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

    Lean IT is a methodology aimed at streamlining the value stream of the product development cycle. Lean focuses on eliminating unnecessary processes that don't add value and creating processes to optimize the value stream.

    DevOps focuses on the development and deployment – the Dev and Ops – part of the product development process. Its goal is to effectively integrate automated tools and roles between IT professionals to achieve more streamlined and automated processes.
