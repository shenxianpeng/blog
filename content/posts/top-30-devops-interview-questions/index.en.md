## DevOps Terminology and Definitions

1. What is DevOps?

    In simplest terms, DevOps is the grey area between the Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) teams in the product development process. DevOps is a culture that emphasizes communication, integration, and collaboration within the product development lifecycle.  Therefore, it eliminates the silos between software development and operations teams, enabling them to integrate and deploy products rapidly and continuously.

2. What is Continuous Integration?

    Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where team members frequently integrate their work.  It utilizes automated tests to verify and assert that their code doesn't conflict with the existing codebase. Ideally, code changes should be automatically built (including compilation, publishing, automated testing) with the help of CI tools on each commit, ideally daily, to detect integration errors early, ensuring merged code doesn't break the main branch.

3. What is Continuous Delivery?

    Continuous Delivery (CD), along with Continuous Integration, provides a complete flow for delivering code packages. At this stage, automated build tools are used to compile artifacts and make them ready for delivery to end-users.  Its goal is to make the building, testing, and releasing of software faster and more frequent. This approach reduces the cost and time of software development and minimizes risks.

4. What is Continuous Deployment?

    Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery to the next level by integrating new code changes and automatically delivering them to the release branch. More specifically, updates are directly deployed to end-users as soon as they pass all stages of the production process, without human intervention.  Therefore, to successfully leverage continuous deployment, software artifacts must first go through a rigorously established process of automated testing and tooling before being deployed to production.

5. What is Continuous Testing and its benefits?

    Continuous testing is the practice of applying automated tests early, often, and appropriately throughout the software delivery pipeline.  In a typical CI/CD workflow, releases are built in small batches. Therefore, manually executing test cases for each delivery is impractical. Automated continuous testing eliminates manual steps and transforms them into automated routines, reducing human effort. Thus, automated continuous testing is crucial for a DevOps culture.

    Benefits of Continuous Testing:

    * Ensures quality and speed of builds.
    * Supports faster software delivery and continuous feedback mechanisms.
    * Detects errors immediately as they appear in the system.
    * Reduces business risks; assesses potential problems before they become actual issues.

6. What is Version Control and its uses?

    Version control (or source code control) is a repository where all changes in the source code are consistently stored. Version control provides an operational history of code development, faithfully recording information such as file changes, time, and person. Version control is the origin of continuous integration and continuous build.

7. What is Git?

    Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in a code repository. Leveraging GitHub flow, Git centers around a branch-based workflow that simplifies team collaboration as team projects evolve.

## Reasons for Implementing DevOps

8. Why is DevOps important? How does DevOps benefit teams in software delivery?

    In today's digital world, organizations must reshape their product deployment systems to be more robust and flexible to keep pace with the competition.

    This is where the DevOps concept comes into play. DevOps plays a crucial role in generating mobility and agility for the entire software development pipeline (from conception to deployment to the end-user). DevOps is the solution that integrates a simpler, more efficient process for constantly updating and improving products.

9. Explain how DevOps helps developers

    In a world without DevOps, a developer's workflow would start with building new code, delivering and integrating it, and then the operations team would be responsible for packaging and deploying the code. After that, they would have to wait for feedback. And if something went wrong, due to an error, they would have to execute it again. Along the line are countless manual communications between different teams involved in the project.

    By applying DevOps, the developer's task is simplified to just building code, as CI/CD practices have merged and automated the rest of the tasks. Combining engineering and operations teams helps establish better communication and collaboration as the process becomes more transparent and accessible to all team members.

10. Why has DevOps become increasingly popular in software delivery recently?

    DevOps has gained traction in recent years primarily because of its ability to streamline an organization's development, testing, and deployment processes and translate them into business value.

    Technological advancements are rapid.  Therefore, organizations must adopt a new workflow—DevOps and Agile methodologies—to simplify and stimulate their operations and not fall behind other companies. The capabilities of DevOps are clearly demonstrated by the success of continuous deployment methodologies at Facebook and Netflix, which successfully fueled their growth without disrupting ongoing operations.

11. What are the benefits of CI/CD?

    The combination of CI and CD unifies all code changes into a single repository and runs them through automated tests, allowing for the holistic development of a product at all stages, and always ready for deployment.

    CI/CD enables organizations to roll out product updates quickly, efficiently, and automatically as expected by customers.

    In short, a well-planned and executed CI/CD pipeline accelerates release speed and reliability while mitigating code changes and defects in the product. This ultimately leads to higher customer satisfaction.

12. What are the benefits of Continuous Delivery?

    By manually releasing code changes, teams maintain full control over the product.  In certain instances, a new version of the product will be more opportune: a promotional strategy with a clear business purpose.

    By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, IT professionals have more thinking capacity to focus on improving the product without worrying about integration progress.


13. What are the benefits of Continuous Deployment?

    With continuous deployment, developers can fully focus on the product, as their final task in the pipeline is to review pull requests and merge them into the branch. This approach enables rapid deployment and shortens deployment durations by releasing new features and fixes immediately after automated testing.

    Customers will be the ones evaluating the quality of each release. Bug fixes in new releases are easier to handle as each version is now delivered in smaller batches.


## How to Effectively Implement DevOps

14. Define a typical DevOps workflow

    A typical DevOps workflow can be simplified into 4 stages:

    * Version Control: This is the stage where source code is stored and managed. Version control contains different versions of the code.
    * Continuous Integration: In this step, developers start building components, compiling them, verifying them, and then testing them through code reviews, unit tests, and integration tests.
    * Continuous Delivery: This is the next level of Continuous Integration, where the release and testing processes are fully automated. CD ensures new releases are delivered to end-users quickly and sustainably.
    * Continuous Deployment: After an application successfully passes all test requirements, it’s automatically deployed to production servers for release without any human intervention.

15. What are the core operations of DevOps?

    The core operations of DevOps in development and infrastructure are:

    Software development:

    * Code building
    * Code coverage
    * Unit testing
    * Packaging
    * Deployment

    Infrastructure:

    * Provisioning
    * Configuration
    * Orchestration
    * Deployment

16. What precautions should teams consider before implementing DevOps?

    There are some misconceptions about DevOps practices that can lead to disastrous failures when organizations attempt to apply this new methodology:

    * DevOps is not simply about applying new tools and/or creating new “departments” and expecting it to work. In reality, DevOps is considered a culture where development and operations teams follow a common framework.
    * Enterprises do not define a clear vision for their DevOps practice. Applying a DevOps initiative is a significant change for development and operations teams. Therefore, having a clear roadmap, goals, and expectations for integrating DevOps into your organization will eliminate any confusion and provide clear guidelines from early on.
    * After applying DevOps practices throughout the organization, management teams need to establish a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Failures and problems in the system should be seen as valuable media for teams to learn from mistakes and prevent them from happening again.

17. What role does the SCM team play in DevOps?

    Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the practice of tracking and preserving records of the development environment, including all changes and adjustments made within the operating system.

    In DevOps, SCM is built as code under the umbrella of Infrastructure as Code practices.

    SCM simplifies tasks for developers as they no longer need to manually manage the configuration process.  This process is now built in a machine-readable format and is automatically replicated and standardized.

18. What role does the Quality Assurance (QA) team play in DevOps?

    As DevOps practices become increasingly popular in innovative organizations, the responsibilities and relevance of QA teams have shown signs of decline in today’s automated world.

    However, this can be considered a myth. The addition of DevOps does not equate to the end of the QA role. It only means their working environment and required expertise are changing. Therefore, their main focus is professional development to keep up with this ever-changing trend.

    In DevOps, the QA team plays a strategic role in ensuring the stability of continuous delivery practices and performing exploratory testing tasks that automated repetitive tests cannot accomplish. Their expertise in evaluating and detecting the most valuable tests still plays a crucial role in mitigating errors in the final stages of release.

19. What tools are used in DevOps? Describe your experience using any of these tools

    There are different tools in a typical DevOps lifecycle to support different stages of product development. Therefore, the most commonly used tools for DevOps can be categorized into 6 key stages:

    Continuous Development: Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS, Jira
    Continuous Integration: Jenkins, Bamboo, CircleCI
    Continuous Delivery: Nexus, Archiva, Tomcat
    Continuous Deployment: Puppet, Chef, Docker
    Continuous Monitoring: Splunk, ELK Stack, Nagios
    Continuous Testing: Selenium, Katalon Studio


20. How to perform change management in DevOps practices

    Typical change management methodologies need to be appropriately integrated with modern DevOps practices. The first step is to centralize changes into one platform to streamline change, problem, and event management processes.

    Next, enterprises should establish high transparency standards to ensure everyone is on the same page and to ensure accuracy in internal information and communication.

    Layering upcoming changes and establishing a robust strategy will help minimize risks and shorten change cycles.  Finally, organizations should apply automation to their processes and integrate with DevOps software.

## How to Effectively Implement CI/CD

21. What are some core components of CI/CD?

    A stable CI/CD pipeline requires a repository management tool used as a version control system. This allows developers to track changes in software versions.

    Within the version control system, developers can also collaborate on projects, compare between versions, and eliminate any errors they make, thus mitigating disruption for all team members.

    Continuous testing and automated testing are two of the most crucial keys to successfully establishing a seamless CI/CD pipeline. Automated testing must be integrated into all product development stages (including unit, integration, and system tests) to cover all functionalities such as performance, usability, performance, load, stress, and security.

22. What are some common CI/CD practices?

    Here are some best practices for establishing an effective CI/CD pipeline:

    * Cultivate a DevOps culture
    * Implement and leverage continuous integration
    * Deploy to each environment in the same way
    * Fail and restart the pipeline
    * Apply version control
    * Include databases in your pipeline
    * Monitor your continuous delivery process
    * Make your CD pipeline smooth

23. When is the best time to implement CI/CD?

    The transition to DevOps requires a complete reshaping of its software development culture, including workflows, organizational structure, and infrastructure.  Therefore, organizations must be prepared for the significant changes involved in implementing DevOps.

24. What are some common CI/CD servers?

    Visual Studio
    Visual Studio supports a complete DevOps system with agile planning, source code control, package management, test and release automation, and continuous monitoring.

    TeamCity
    TeamCity is an intelligent CI server that provides framework support and code coverage without installing any extra plugins or modules to build scripts.

    Jenkins
    It's a standalone CI server that supports collaboration between development and operations teams through shared pipelines and error tracking. It can also be combined with hundreds of dashboard plugins.

    GitLab
    GitLab users can customize the platform for effective continuous integration and deployment. GitLab helps CI/CD teams speed up code delivery, error identification, and recovery procedures.

    Bamboo
    Bamboo is a continuous integration server for automated product release management. Bamboo tracks all deployments across all tools and communicates errors in real-time.

25. Describe an effective workflow for Continuous Integration

    A successful workflow for implementing continuous integration includes the following practices:

    * Maintain a repository for project source code.
    * Automate the build and integration process.
    * Make builds self-testing.
    * Commit changes to the baseline every day.
    * Build every commit that is added to the baseline.
    * Keep builds fast.
    * Run tests in a clone of the production environment.
    * Easily get the latest deliverable.
    * Make build results easily visible to everyone.
    * Automate deployment.

## Differences Between Each Term

26. What are the key differences between Agile and DevOps?

    Essentially, DevOps and Agile are complementary. Agile focuses more on the values and principles of developing new software and managing complex processes more efficiently.  Meanwhile, DevOps aims to enhance communication, integration, and collaboration between different teams comprised of developers and operations teams.

    It requires adopting both Agile and DevOps methodologies to form a seamlessly working product development lifecycle: Agile principles help shape and guide the right development direction, while DevOps leverages the tools to ensure the product is fully delivered to customers.

27. What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?

    Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of continuously integrating code versions into a shared repository. This practice ensures that new code is automatically tested and allows for the rapid detection and fixing of errors.

    Continuous Delivery takes CI a step further, ensuring that after integration, the codebase is ready for release within a button's push.  Therefore, CI can be considered a prerequisite for Continuous Delivery, another important component of the CI/CD pipeline.

    For Continuous Deployment, no manual steps are required.  Once the code passes tests, it’s automatically pushed to the production environment.

    All three components: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are crucial stages in implementing DevOps.

    Continuous Delivery, on one hand, is better suited for applications where active users already exist, so things can be slowed down a bit and better adjusted. Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, is a more suitable option for your product if you plan to release brand new software and specify the entire process as fully automated.

28. What are the fundamental differences between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

    In Continuous Delivery, the code in the main branch is always manually deployable.  With this practice, the development team can decide when to release new changes or features to maximize benefits for the organization.

    Meanwhile, Continuous Deployment will automatically deploy all updates and patches in the code to the production environment immediately after the testing phase, without any human intervention.

29. What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?

    Continuous Integration helps ensure that software components work well together. Integrations should happen frequently; ideally hourly or daily. Continuous integration helps increase the frequency of code commits and reduces the complexity of connecting code from multiple developers. Ultimately, this process reduces the chance of incompatible code and redundant work.

    Continuous Delivery is the next step in the CI/CD process. As code is continuously integrated into the shared repository, that code can be continuously tested. There's no gap to test while waiting for the code to be finished.  This ensures as many bugs as possible are found and then continuously delivered to production.

30. What is the difference between DevOps and Continuous Delivery?

    DevOps is more of an organizational and cultural approach that fosters collaboration and communication between engineering and operations teams.

    Meanwhile, Continuous Delivery is a crucial factor in successfully implementing DevOps into a product development workflow. Continuous Delivery practices help make new releases more mundane and reliable and establish a more seamless and shorter process.

    The primary goal of DevOps is to effectively combine Dev and Ops roles, eliminate all silos, and achieve business objectives independent of Continuous Delivery practices.

    Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, works best if there's already a DevOps process in place.  Therefore, it expands collaboration and simplifies a unified product development cycle for the organization.


31. What is the difference between Agile, Lean IT, and DevOps?

    Agile is a methodology that focuses solely on software development. Agile aims to iterate development, establish continuous delivery, shorten feedback loops, and improve team collaboration throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

    Lean IT is a methodology aimed at simplifying the value stream of the product development lifecycle. Lean focuses on eliminating unnecessary processes that do not add value and creating processes to optimize the value stream.

    DevOps focuses on the Dev and Ops—the development and deployment—aspects of the product development process. Its goal is to effectively integrate automated tools and roles between IT professionals to achieve a more streamlined and automated process.
