Time flies, and 2024 is coming to an end. If I don't record what happened this year, it will be difficult to recall it after a while. As usual, this year-end summary is here on schedule.

Looking back at the goals I set at the beginning of the year, some were achieved, some were done but not very well, and some were not achieved at all.



1. Career Development:  Hope to successfully navigate the career development phase and usher in a new and challenging beginning. ✅
2. Family Health: Family members remain healthy, achieve work-life balance, and take them out more often. ✅
3. Skill Enhancement:  Address some shortcomings in the DevOps field and strive to improve through real-world projects. ⏳
4. Sharing and Growth: Continuously share knowledge through blogs and public accounts, learning by teaching. ✅
5. Maintain Exercise: Whether running or playing soccer, strive to lose weight. ❌

In summary, the goals for 2024 were generally well-met except for the weight loss goal.

## Reviewing 2024

Looking back at this year, the biggest change was my job, which also led to changes in my life. This is the biggest change I've experienced in the ten years since I returned to Dalian after leaving Shanghai and Beijing.

### Cherishing Every Day

From December 2013, I knew I would be leaving the company I had worked for nearly 10 years at the end of June 2024, and I might be working in Europe.

From that moment on, I began to cherish every day of my work and life. Whenever I had time, I would take my family out more often.

Here's a brief account, recording my incredibly cherished seven months in China:

* January: I injured my ankle playing badminton, so I participated in fewer activities, but I still went to the company's event at the Jinshitang Luneng Hot Spring Resort despite my injury.
* February: My child suffered an accidental burn, which was a dark moment for our whole family. We spent the entire Spring Festival in the hospital, and thinking about it still makes me feel heartbroken.
* March:  Visited my sister's house at the beginning of the month, went to the Dalian Forest Zoo in the middle of the month, and took my parents to Dandong at the end of the month, visiting the Yalu River Bridge and the Korean War Memorial Museum.
* April: Visited relatives and friends many times, went to the zoo, and participated in company-organized activities such as hiking up Xiaohéishan Mountain and picking blueberries and strawberries.
* May: My parents came to Dalian at the beginning of the month to celebrate my child's birthday; at the end of the month, we went to Tokyo, Japan, to apply for a visa.
* June: Went camping with my child's friends' parents at the beginning of the month; went back to my hometown in the middle of the month and took my parents for a trip to the provincial capital; went to the zoo again; officially ended my work at the Dalian company at the end of the month.
* July: Had a farewell dinner with friends at the beginning of the month; took my child back to my hometown alone, and I cried the moment I drove away from my parents; then went to Japan to collect the visa and visited Tokyo Disneyland; left for Europe at the end of the month, feeling heavyhearted.

These little moments made up the precious memories of the first half of 2024.

### Enjoying Every Day of Work

In the first half of the year, I prepared for the handover while completing my regular work, consistently and diligently practicing DevOps best practices. Although the results are still unknown.

But I really enjoyed every day on the job, including coffee breaks, lunch walks, listening to my favorite content, occasional runs, and badminton time every Tuesday and Thursday.


### Spare Time: Adhering to Open Source and Writing

As in the previous year, I continued doing the same things in my spare time:

1. Open Source Projects
    * `cpp-linter-action`:  Has over a thousand users, including well-known projects such as Microsoft, Jupyter, and the Linux Foundation.
    * `commit-check`: Optimized and added user requests, with a steady increase in the number of users.
    * `gitstats`: This is a new open-source project I took over this year, hoping to help more people.
2. Writing — Updated 27 blog posts and 41 WeChat official account articles throughout the year, significantly exceeding expectations.
3. Learning — The plan to join well-known communities for learning and contribution continues, but taking care of my child after work has significantly reduced my free time.


## Looking Forward to 2025

2024 was a special year for many people. No matter where you are, you can feel the instability of the political situation and the pessimistic economic outlook.

Will 2025 be better? Probably not, but I still have hope: I hope that in the future, I will have a job, food to eat, a place to live, and that my family will be healthy and safe.

If I have any wishes, they are:

1. Wish my family good health.
2. Travel to other European countries and try to watch a game of my favorite team.
3. Obtain Azure certification.
4. Participate in a DevOps or Python conference.
5. Join PyPA or the Python GitHub Organization.
6. Avoid gaining weight and maintain exercise.

Wishes I'm not confident about achieving are described using "strive to." :)
