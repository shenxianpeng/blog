Lately, I've been listening to Zhao Lei's songs while driving, especially "I Remember."

I think this song is a symphony of memories; every time I hear it, it's like watching an old movie. It's a kind of sound, a touching sensation, that allows us to recall the time that has passed, to reflect on our lifestyles and the direction of our lives.


The lyrics and melody are full of nostalgic emotions, always reminding me of all the greetings and blessings I received during this period.

While the memories are still fresh, I want to record them all, also titled "I Remember":

* June 14th (Friday): My 1024 football team organized a dinner for me. At that time, only my visa had been approved, which was a good start. That night, I drank all the beer I'd accumulated over the years. Thankfully, the alcohol content wasn't very high, and I wasn't hungover when I got home.
* June 27th (Thursday): I went to Qiankuli Buffet with colleagues and leaders. My feelings were mixed because I was graduating the next day. We took a cheerful group photo together.
* June 28th (Friday): On my graduation day, many colleagues came to say goodbye, and I remember them seeing me off from the company and building. Finally, Da Chao and I went down the mountain together; he went home, and I waited for the bus.
* June 30th (Sunday): I happened to meet my colleague, Dashi, at Xiaoping Island. I was sending shoes to the laundry, and he was buying groceries. We stood on the roadside and chatted for a long time, and took a photo together before parting ways.
* July 1st (Monday): I had lunch with my childhood friend and old classmate. We walked around Tengfei and then he accompanied me to the 4S shop for car maintenance and tire repair. We chatted for the afternoon; it had been a long time since I'd had a long, one-on-one conversation with someone. It felt good. We took a photo to commemorate the occasion.
* July 4th (Thursday): I took my daughter back to my hometown alone so my parents could see their granddaughter again. The entire round trip was 6 hours. My daughter sat in her car seat the whole time and behaved exceptionally well.
* July 7th (Sunday): My wife, daughter, and I had a delicious lunch at my father-in-law's house. That same day, in the afternoon, I went swimming with my coach at the city stadium. After returning to Tengfei, I had a cup of coffee, a small snack, and walked half a circle around Tengfei, chatting until we ran out of things to say.
* July 8th (Monday): I joined my former colleagues for a badminton game.
* July 9th (Tuesday): I played my last football game here with the 1024 football team.  The opposing team had an incredibly strong goalkeeper, which left a deep impression on me. Another memorable moment was probably my long-range shot from the backfield.
* July 10th (Wednesday): I went back to Japan to get my card and also visited Tokyo Disney. Although it rained that day, it was still a great experience.
* July 14th (Sunday): I returned from Japan. That afternoon, colleagues and friends went to a mutton soup restaurant for a meal and chatted for several hours.
* July 15th (Monday): I saw my childhood friend; he was fishing by the sea, and I went along. It was my first time using a fishing rod, and I even caught a tiny fish.
* July 16th (Tuesday): I started my journey. Although I felt a thousand regrets, it was time to leave. I knew the sadness I felt was real, and I also knew that I would definitely move on. That evening, I took the high-speed rail to Beijing, where I met a university classmate at the airport. We chatted for a while, but it was late, so our reunion was brief.
* July 17th (Wednesday): After a flight of more than ten hours, our family finally arrived in Weicun. Thus ended my brief graduation season.


I cherish these memories, so I've written down these few words to record all the beautiful things that happened.

These memories will remind me that no matter how life changes, we will never forget the past, but we must also be full of hope and expectation for the future, experiencing the beauty and hope of life.

Although life is full of difficulties and challenges, as long as we have memories of the past and expectations for the future, life is full of meaning and value.

Beautiful music also touches our emotions, inspires our thoughts, and brings us strength and hope.
