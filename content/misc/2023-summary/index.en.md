Time flies, and 2023 has passed in a flash. If I don't record what happened this year, it will be difficult to recall what happened soon.

Therefore, as usual, I will first review 2023 and then look forward to 2024.


## Reviewing 2023

Looking back on this year, I would use three keywords to describe my life, work, and leisure time.

### Life: "Dad"

Since the birth of my child, my teammate and I have been independently taking care of the baby. During the day I work, and she takes care of the child; in the evening, I rush home after work, play with the child, do housework until the child goes to sleep. On weekends, we'll take the child out for a stroll at least one day.

Taking care of the child can be tiring and long, but looking back on this year, I've found that the child has grown up in the blink of an eye. At the beginning of the year, the child could only crawl and stand with support; by the end of the year, the child can climb tables and run, with endless energy.

Next is a simple record of the small events in this ordinary year:

* April: Went to Discovery Kingdom, climbed Tongniuling, played San Guo Sha (a card game), and had a seafood buffet at Yu Gong Wharf with the company.
* May: Held birthday parties for the child in Xinghai and Zhuanghe.
* September: Took the child to a hotel for the first time, stayed at the Hilton Jin Shi Tan for one night, and had a hotel buffet breakfast.
* October: Returned to Zhuanghe for one night during the National Day holiday, had a family barbecue; went to Hengshan Temple, had a vegetarian buffet; played a soccer game during the holiday; bought a membership card for Dalian Forest Zoo and started visiting the zoo.
* November: Visited Dalian Forest Zoo, Lushun Sun Gully, Dalian Natural Museum, and attended a company dinner in Qianku.
* December: Received very sudden news (I will elaborate on this later), participated in team building, visited Dalian Museum, accompanied my father to the hospital for a checkup, and visited Lushun Museum.

### Work: Upholding "Best Practices"

This year, I continued to uphold DevOps best practices:

1. Continued expanding the application scope of the Ansible Playbook repository.
2. Created an Infrastructure as Code repository to manage infrastructure with code.
3. Created a Docker Image repository to containerize products and applied many of my DevOps practices in the Bitbucket repository.
4. Undertook more product build and release work.
5. Proposed and implemented Software Supply Chain Security ideas.
6. Shared DevOps practices within the team, sharing them with other teams in the form of a Jenkins shared library.

### Leisure Time: Enthusiast of "Open Source and Writing"

As with last year, I continued doing the same things in my spare time:

1. Open Source Projects:
  * `cpp-linter-action`: Currently has over 400 users, including well-known open-source projects such as Microsoft, Jupyter, Waybar, libvips, desktop, and chocolate-doom. I hope to have more ideas to improve it in the future.
  * `commit-check`: Currently in its early stages of development, with few users. It still needs optimization and the introduction of more good ideas.
2. Writing: In 2023, I updated 20 blog posts + 6 WeChat official account articles, falling slightly short of my initial goal of 24 (blog) + 12 (WeChat).
3. Learning: I did not achieve my goal of learning and contributing to well-known communities. Having a child has really limited my free time. I hope that in 2024, the child will go to bed earlier so I can have more time for myself.


## Looking Forward to 2024

I still need to set some wishes or flags for each year, just in case they come true!

1. Hope to smoothly pass through the career development period, hoping it will be a fresh and challenging start.
2. Family health, work-life balance, and taking them out for more trips.
3. Make up for some shortcomings in DevOps, and strive to participate in practical projects to improve.
4. Teach and learn, continue sharing on blogs and WeChat official accounts, and maintain personal growth.
5. Maintain exercise, whether running or playing soccer, and lose weight.
