Time flies quickly. At the end of each year, I write a running account to record my life and work from the past year. I hope my future self will still remember what happened this year.

## Year-Beginning Flag Completion Status

Looking back at the flags I set at the beginning of the year, some were achieved, some were completed but not ideally, and some were not done at all.

1. Travel to other European countries, watch a football match

   Half completed. I went to Austria, but didn't visit football powerhouses like Spain or Italy, nor did I get to watch a match.

2. Obtain Azure certification

    With the rapid development of AI, this goal seemed less important, so I temporarily put it aside.
  
3. Participate in a DevOps or Python conference

    In April, I went to PyCon LT and wrote three conference articles: [Day 1](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/misc/pycon-lt-d1/), [Day 2](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/misc/pycon-lt-d2/), [Day 3](https://shenxianpeng.github.io/misc/pycon-lt-d3/).

4. Join PyPA or Python GitHub Organization

    This year, I created a new open-source project [Explain Error Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/explain-error/), and thus joined the Jenkins GitHub Organization. The goal of joining PyPA and Python GitHub Organization has not been achieved yet, but I hope to have the opportunity to join in the future.

5. Don't gain weight, keep exercising

    I didn't gain much weight this year, but my exercise volume wasn't high either. I hope to do better in 2026.

In summary, although not all were completed, it's still a decent achievement.

## Looking Back at 2025

I actually don't remember what happened in 2025, so I looked through my calendar and photos to recall the bits and pieces of the year.

*   January: Celebrated New Year in Vilnius, prepared to go back home to visit relatives at the end of the month.
*   February: Went back to my hometown for Chinese New Year, but caught a cold for several days due to insufficient rest, and later got chickenpox. Afterwards, I worked while spending time with family, and only started meeting friends after recovering from chickenpox.
*   March: Started intermittent holidays, went to the beach, Saint-Ya, zoo, and other places to spend time with my child and family.
*   April: Returned to Vilnius. Each departure brings reluctance, and it's only after returning to Vilnius that I can slowly get back into my life and work rhythm. Afterwards, I attended PyCon LT and took my child to a basketball game.
*   May: Drove to Kaunas, where I celebrated my child's third birthday, and visited landmarks such as Kaunas Zoo and Kaunas Old Town. At the end of the month, I went to see Vilnius' Pink Soup Festival.
*   June: Trip to Austria, went to Wolfgang (the lake and mountain scenery is beautiful), Vienna, and other places. At the end of the month, I visited a colleague's home for the first time.
*   July: Took a train to Klaipėda, visited the Maritime Museum, mainly wanting to play with sand and water at the beach, but unfortunately, the weather wasn't great those days.
*   August: Explored the Old Town, preparing for my child's kindergarten to start.
*   September: My child successfully started kindergarten. Although they cried twice, they gradually adapted well. I took my child to Vilnius' Capital Days festival.
*   October: Business as usual for work and life. Went out more on weekends, as it would be hard to see such good weather next month.
*   November: Still the same. Originally planned to go to Poland, but canceled due to being too busy with work. I'll see if there's a chance this year.
*   December: As the holidays approached, I became even busier. I attended Vilnius' Christmas market and my child's kindergarten Christmas event, then embarked on the journey back home.

These bits and pieces form the precious memories of 2025.

## Looking Ahead to 2026

In 2026, I don't plan to set too many flags (goals), I just hope to do the following things well:

1.  Keep exercising, and ensure both my family and I are healthy.
2.  Spend more time with family, go out more, and communicate more with others.
3.  Persist in writing and open-source, especially the newly started weekly update project 《攻城狮周刊》.
4.  Pay more attention to AI technologies and applications, integrating them deeper into work and study.

If I want to set a goal for **my future self 1000 days from now**, it would probably be:

*   Develop my own "second leg" to explore more possibilities.
*   Have more flexible and free work and life, and always maintain passion.

I hope my future self, when seeing these words, can still smile while recalling this year.

I also wish you good health, smooth work, and a happy life in the new year!
