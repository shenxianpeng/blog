My daughter is two years and seven months old, and I haven't written a separate article about her yet.

My daughter is a very active little girl, full of energy every day, so much so that I often accompany her from 6:30 pm when I get home from work until after midnight before she finally falls asleep.

Tonight is Friday night, it's 12:30 am, and she's still bouncing around and doesn't want to sleep.  She finally went to bed at 1:00 am. But then she suddenly got out of bed and wanted an apple.


In the past, at 11 pm, I would try my best to satisfy her to get her to sleep, but it was too late tonight, so I sternly told her again: after the lights are off, you can only drink water, nothing else to eat or drink.

She clearly resisted my refusal and started crying and making a fuss! But this time I didn't want to give in, sitting on the bed, no matter how she pushed or pulled me to the kitchen, I remained motionless.

She was so angry at my actions that she cried until she was out of breath.

To be honest, my heart ached, and I was also hesitant.

My heart ached because she was crying so hard; I hesitated because I wondered if what I was doing was right?

In the end, when I got the toilet paper to wipe her tears and nose, my two-year-old daughter, in her "sensitive period of order," stopped crying and no longer thought about the apple.

Finally, she lay on me, wouldn't talk to me, and wouldn't let me leave the kitchen. I held her like that for about five minutes.

Then I asked her: Do you love Daddy? She didn't speak.

I asked her again: Do you love Mommy? She still didn't speak.

I don't remember which sentence it was, but she agreed to go back to the bedroom with me to sleep.

When she lay beside me, I held her close, listening to her breathing. When I moved my arm away from her, she said: Daddy hug!

My heart melted at that moment.

I asked her again: Do you love Daddy? She said, "Love!" Do you love Mommy? She said, "Love!"

I said Daddy and Mommy love you too!

As her breathing deepened, I knew she had fallen asleep.

At this moment, reflecting on everything that just happened, I felt I was wrong. From the beginning, I didn't make it clear to her what she could and couldn't do before bed.

She could eat apples before, but today Daddy suddenly wouldn't let her eat apples, and she obviously couldn't understand. (Although from my perspective, it was because it was too late).

In my heart, I silently said, Daughter, I'm sorry! Please give Daddy some patience, this is my first time being a father, and I still need to learn how to be a good father.

As I write this article, my daughter is fast asleep beside me. — _Written at 2:41 am on December 28, 2024_
