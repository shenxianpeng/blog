Instead of working overtime on Tuesday evening as usual (I usually leave work after 6 pm to avoid the evening rush hour), I rushed to the airport by subway to catch an 8:30 flight to Beijing.  I was attending the JFrog China Jenkins, Artifactory & Kubernetes hands-on training camp in Wangjing, Beijing, the next day.

Firstly, my company provides each employee with two days of paid training leave per year. If there's a suitable training, I'll pay for it myself. Secondly, the training content is very relevant to my current work. I wanted to learn about industry best practices and exchange ideas with colleagues.

Before the trip, I asked my supervisor for leave and inquired about the possibility of a budget for such training.  My supervisor asked me to submit a cost estimate.  I roughly calculated the cost of airfare and hotel, and my supervisor applied for it with the company, also applying for a meal allowance for me. The company agreed, with the only condition being that I give a presentation upon my return. So, I attended the JFrog DevOps training camp with a mission, and I am particularly grateful to my supervisor and the company.

## Revisiting Beijing

It's been more than five years since I left Beijing. This was the longest 48 hours I've spent in Beijing; previously, I only passed through on business trips. Although I worked in Beijing before, I didn't pay much attention to life back then. This time, I deliberately observed, constantly pondering a question: If I were to return to Beijing again, would I still have the same obsession with only wanting to work in Beijing for a few years?

It was already 10:30 pm when I landed. The traffic on the airport expressway to Wangjing was still heavy. Beijing's nightlife felt the same as before—it's two or three hours later than in smaller cities. Five years ago in Beijing, I usually left the office after 9 pm, and if there was a launch, I wouldn't get home until the middle of the night, only to arrive at the company again around noon the next day. My daily schedule was five or six hours later than it is now in smaller cities.

My current life is from 9 am to 6 pm; overtime is discouraged.  Work is busy, but most people don't work overtime; it's voluntary. I've been on a business trip to the US. Many US colleagues start work at 7 or 8 am. They usually have a simple and quick lunch. If they are busy, they immediately return to work and leave the office at 3 or 4 pm. Very few stay until 5 or 6 pm, but their work efficiency doesn't seem to be any worse. This reminded me of the heated 996 debate this year. Perhaps it's fundamentally due to our stage of social development. Young people are under a lot of pressure to earn money to buy houses. Those with children have their parents to help with childcare, and older people don't consider their retirement life but are more concerned about helping their children with their worries, allowing young people to work 996 with peace of mind. But Americans can't do this; they are very realistic. If they don't leave work by 3 or 4 pm, no one will pick up their children, and they need their family life. Therefore, what should be borne by enterprises or even society is borne by the entire society, so 996 naturally occurs.

During rush hour, elderly people were directing traffic at some intersections in Wangjing. When the light turned green, a large number of electric bicycles and bicycles, along with pedestrians, would pass simultaneously. I was always worried about being hit. In the evening, after dinner, on my way back, there was no traffic control at the intersection, and it was quite common for pedestrians, bicycles, and electric bicycles to cross the road when the light was red, resulting in very low motor vehicle通行 efficiency when the light was green. Also, while walking, bicycles and electric bicycles would pass by frequently, and I was always worried about being hit. This feeling of anxiety while walking is quite uncomfortable.

I had lunch with a friend and he talked about his work over the past five years. He had changed several companies, some with internal strife, and some with P2P defaults (still owed wages, currently in arbitration).  Discussions about recent layoffs in large Beijing companies and the recent layoff turmoil at NetEase made me feel that it's difficult to make a living anywhere.  As he's about to become a father, he, who had never considered leaving Beijing, now has thoughts of leaving. If he can't buy a small house in Beijing in the future, he may return to his hometown to live in the house he already owns.

With cost controls, many companies have moved to second- and third-tier cities where rent is four or five times cheaper than in Beijing. If they can recruit people, they can set up shop there. When I was in Beijing, my roommate worked at the China Mobile Research Institute. Later, the institute moved to Suzhou, and he and several other colleagues also moved there. They have already bought a house there; the environment is good, they have their own houses, and their salaries are not low, so their life is quite comfortable.  Especially in the software industry, some companies allow remote work, which is great as long as job requirements are met. Some friends' companies have closed their Beijing offices, and they now work from home, occasionally traveling to second- and third-tier city offices for work and communication with colleagues.


The question kept circling my mind: Given another chance, would you still want to live in Beijing? My decision remains the same as before—to return to my current city.

I like the work-life balance here. Overtime is voluntary learning, not forced overtime for the boss; I like the sea here; after lunch, I can walk to the beach with my colleagues; I like that I live close to my parents—a half-hour drive away—and can often visit and care for them; I like living in my own house, without worrying about moving and continually improving my living environment; I like that there aren't too many people here, there are all the necessary department stores and malls, and there is a subway; it's not too far to go anywhere.

The training ended at 5 pm on Thursday. After dinner, I rushed to the airport and returned home overnight, returning to work the next day.  These two short days, traveling between two cities for work and training, only a 40-minute flight, felt like I never left, highlighting the convenience of transportation.

I wish everyone a fulfilling life.
