### Workplace frustrations I've experienced as someone not good at expressing myself

- Overinterpreting the meaning of emails and chats with colleagues;
- Continuously pondering disagreements with colleagues after the fact;
- Being overly concerned about my superiors' opinions of my work successes and failures.

### Approaches that have worked for me


- Focusing more of my energy on the work itself;
- Focusing on the work, not the peopleâ€”doing the right thing;
- Taking a long-term perspective, remembering my initial goals, and concentrating on what I should be doing;
- My leader's words, "Look forward," have left a deep impression on me.  Let the past be the past; don't dwell on it, look forward.
