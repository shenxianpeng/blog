Time flies, another year has passed.

This year, I want to write a summary to review the important events that happened to me in the past year.

Since I didn't write a year-end summary in 2021, my memories of 2021 have become blurry. I can only recall some things based on photos and diaries.  It seems I cannot miss year-end summaries in the future.


## Reviewing 2021

My personal keyword for 2021 is "Final Splendor".

At the beginning of the year, I moved. My new home is only a dozen minutes' drive from the company. This saved a lot of commuting time, and I was more willing to go to the company on weekends.

In April, I forked and started maintaining the open-source project [cpp-linter-action](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action) for the first time, and attracted another developer to maintain it with me.

In July, I traveled to Guanglu Island.

In August, my wife became pregnant. Looking back at the photos from 2021, our life as a couple was so carefree and splendid; two people could easily support themselves.

In November, I was informed that I was a secondary close contact and was required to quarantine at a hotel.  So we were taken to a hotel for a week of quarantine, and then we had to quarantine for another week at home after returning.  Looking back now, it's unbelievable!


## Reviewing 2022

My personal keyword for 2022 is "Responsibility".

In May, with the birth of my daughter, almost all my time outside of work was spent taking care of my family, leaving me with little time for learning and output.

The birth of my child made me directly feel the weight of responsibility. Raising a child requires not only time but also money. I truly became a middle-aged man with aging parents and a young child, and I can't afford to collapse for a moment.

I used to think I could do anything, and the future was bright. Now I feel the heavy responsibility on my shoulders, and I can no longer lie flat.

From June to September, I took paternity leave. As a full-time stay-at-home dad, I sacrificed some rest time during my child's sleep to read and contribute to open source.

From October to December, I returned to my post, and due to the epidemic, I worked from home most of the time. Working during the day, taking care of the child at night, I no longer had large chunks of time for learning and output.

Therefore, I produced very few articles this year. I published a total of 19 articles on my blog, and only 11 articles on my WeChat official account. Most of this output occurred in the first half of the year before my child was born.

In my spare time, my top priority was still open-source projects, which allowed me to learn more. I spent a lot of my spare time on the [cpp-linter](https://github.com/cpp-linter) project. Currently, [cpp-linter-action](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action) is used (depended on) by more than 100 other projects. I hope to make cpp-linter the preferred code formatter and static analysis tool for all C/C++ projects.


## Outlook for 2023

- Balance work and family. I hope my daughter grows up healthy, sleeps through the night soon, so that Dad can work and study at night.
- Make progress in English and technology, such as passing the TOEIC Tests, joining a well-known Python organization, and learning cloud technologies.
- Exceed the number of articles published on my blog and WeChat official account in 2022, aiming for 24 (blog) + 12 (WeChat official account) – not a high bar, right?
- Maintain good health, resume swimming, football, and exercise, and get my weight back below 160 jin (approximately 160 pounds).
