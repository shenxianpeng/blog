### This Trip Home Went By Too Fast

Since landing in Dalian on December 18th, this past month and a bit feels like it's been on fast forward.

The first few days back were simple: eating at home, sleeping, adjusting to the time difference. My body was back, but my mind was still catching up. Going to the mall, the supermarket, eating at my parents' place—life instantly returned to its most familiar rhythm.

The days that followed were almost entirely spent in a cycle of "spending time with family, taking care of the child, and meeting friends."

### The Days Were Fragmented, Yet Full

Taking the kid to my sister's house while my wife went to her concert;
Taking Mom to the hospital in the afternoon, then going to Wanda to eat lamian in the evening;
Swimming, eating, and having coffee with colleagues, talking about work, technology, and AI;
Taking a long bath, browsing Uniqlo, eating at my mother-in-law's house;
Gatherings, playing soccer, watching movies, shopping at IKEA, going to Decathlon…

Each of these things is ordinary on its own, but when linked together so densely, they formed a "pace of life unique to being home."

No need for planning, no need for efficiency above all else; it was more about "going with the flow."

Going wherever we wanted, seeing whoever was available.

In mid-January, the child caught a cold and developed a fever.

Going to the children's hospital, getting medicine, observing, going back to the hospital, for several days straight. The focus of life narrowed down to just one thing: wishing the child would get better soon.

Fortunately, they slowly recovered later.

### Unforgettable Moments Not Deliberately Recorded

*   Parting ways with my parents at IKEA, watching them get off the bus early to walk home, I suddenly remembered our last farewell, and my heart sank.
*   Spending Sunday with the whole family at my parents' place, from noon till night, doing nothing in particular, yet time flew by.
*   My new MacBook Air arrived, which made me happy, but that happiness was quickly overshadowed by daily life.
*   One day, I took the child alone, driving to my parents' place. I listened to music on the way, and the child fell asleep in the back seat. That moment was especially quiet and deeply satisfying.

Life is like this; important things and trivial things always happen intertwined.

### The Hardest Part Is Saying Goodbye

On January 23rd, we went to my parents' place for dinner.

Deep down, I already knew—this was the last meal.

For a month, we had eaten, chatted, and moved around together almost every day. It was really hard to adjust to it suddenly ending. The moment I closed the door and said goodbye to my parents, I couldn't hold back my tears.

On the drive home, my emotions were complex.

I felt time had passed too quickly, and that I hadn't spent enough time with them.

On January 24th, the child's great-aunt and other aunt's family all came, and we spent a lively afternoon together. In the evening, we were taken to the airport, and my wife and her sister hugged and cried.

At that moment, I suddenly realized:
**It wasn't just us leaving; they were also experiencing a loss.**

### In Conclusion

This trip home had no tourist check-ins, no grand plans.

Only eating, chatting, shopping, visiting the doctor, playing soccer, taking care of the child, and repeated goodbyes.

But it was precisely these seemingly "nothing" days that formed the most authentic and precious time.

The vacation ended, and I returned to my original routine.
But I know that this past month will stay in my heart for a long time.

All that's left is one sentence, a constant reminder to myself:

**When we can still be together, cherish it.**
