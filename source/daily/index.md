## 8/30/2020 - Demonstrate Project Build & formal start of decoration

> Sunday, sunny.

I looked back my daily report so that I can remeber what did I do past two weeks in work. I don't want to mention my regular work just like make build, release products, etc... I just want to write what I learn in the past two week

### About Work

1. Learn how to show python project doc file online. can create a GitHub Pages which is a GitHub build-in feature. then will have a website like https://\<github-username\>.github.io/\<repo-name\>.html

2. Live demo our 4 person team build project which is analyze Bitbucket git history and provide below features

### About Life

1. From last two week,  my colleagues and I start swimming in the indoor pool on veery Friday night. we want to lose weight in this actitices but we always to eat after swimming, this is not good for us to lose weight :(

2. We finally determinded that use IKEA house design, and completed the final design last Saturday. so this Saturday we finally started, and they set up a simple start ceremony for me, thanks! \then the first thing is I need to look at tiles, after various studies and comparisons, we finally ordered a large brand of tiles. Although it is more expensive, it is still worth it.


## 8/16/2020 - What is the core knowledge I need to learn

> Sunday, cloudy. IKEA measure the house, then I go to the company to study.

This week I always thinking what's the most importand knowledge to me? Learn more about DevOps tools? or others? No. 

I final come out the two points I need to enhance. ability of communicate and and knowledge of the primordial.

1. expecilly is English communicate. I should setup some goal to achive. like TOEIC exam.
2. need to use more time on reading such as Code Completed, C Primer books.

OK, Keep doing both. ðŸ’ª
