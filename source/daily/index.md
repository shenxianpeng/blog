Start from Aug 7, 2020, I would like to start recording my weekly or some regular daily things in English.


## 8/16/2020 - What is the core knowledge I need to learn

This week I always thinking what's the most importand knowledge to me? Learn more about DevOps tools? or others? No. 

I final come out the two points I need to enhance. ability of communicate and and knowledge of the primordial.

1. expecilly is English communicate. I should setup some goal to achive. like TOEIC exam.
2. need to use more time on reading such as Code Completed, C Primer books.

OK, Keep doing both. ðŸ’ª
