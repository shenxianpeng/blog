## 11/1/2020 - Learn and Test English and Update decorate progress.

> Sunday, sunny.

### English

Today I clean English from App and have a test of the TOEiC, the test score is 64. From my test results seems not some big progress because my test results never more than 70, I hope I can keep testing every weekend so that to improve my English and hope next time of the test will achieve about 70 :)

### The House Decoration

From Oct my house had finished ceramic tile seam beauty, suspended ceiling, the laying of part of the marble and now is whitewashing. 

Last Friday I paid the money of the custom kitchen and furniture, it's more than 40,000 RMB, it's not too more expect but it's over my budget in total. they will ship the furniture on Friday and install them next Saturday. Before that, I must prepare the kitchen appliances, so from Last night (11.1) start to buy , the price is good. 

So, in the coming two weeks my house demonstrate will have big progress, this is so much to look forward to. Cheers!

## 8/30/2020 - Demonstrate Project Build & formal start of decoration

> Sunday, sunny.

I looked back my daily report so that I can remember what did I do the past two weeks in work. I don't want to mention my regular work just like make build, release products, etc... I just want to write what I learn in the past two week

### About Work

### About Life

1. From the last two weeks,  my colleagues and I start swimming in the indoor pool on veery Friday night. we want to lose weight in these activities but we always to eat after swimming, this is not good for us to lose weight :(

2. We finally determine that use the IKEA house design, and completed the final design last Saturday. so this Saturday we finally started, and they set up a simple start ceremony for me, thanks! \then the first thing is I need to look at tiles, after various studies and comparisons, we finally ordered a large brand of tiles. Although it is more expensive, it is still worth it.


## 8/16/2020 - What is the core knowledge I need to learn

> Sunday, cloudy. IKEA measure the house, then I go to the company to study.

This week I always thinking what's the most important knowledge to me? Learn more about DevOps tools? or others? No. 

I final come out the two points I need to enhance. the ability of communicate and knowledge of the primordial.

1. especially is English communicate. I should setup some goals to archive. like the TOEIC exam.
2. need to use more time on reading such as Code Completed, C Primer books.

OK, Keep doing both. ðŸ’ª
